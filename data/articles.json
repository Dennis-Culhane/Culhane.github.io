    "abstract": "This study tracks the 761 community mental health centers which received federal grants as of 1981 and assesses their status 10 years after the shift to Block Grant financing. Contrary to what had been predicted (Biegel, 1982), the vast majority of centers remained open (88.3%), a small proportion were involved in mergers (8.5%) and an even smaller percentage closed (3.3%). No pattern was evident as to which centers closed or merged by type of initial funding, although some states showed a concentration of mergers and closures. Data from the 1988 Inventory of Mental Health Organizations are used to characterize the centers still in operation by facility type, ownership, service mix and revenue mix. In 1988, federally funded CMHCs accounted for 34% of the total patient episodes treated and 22.7% of the total revenues reported by speciality mental health providers in the United States.",

Using integrated archival administrative data from the public school district and the municipal Office of Supportive Housing, multilevel linear models were estimated to test these associations while adjusting for nesting of students within schools. Findings demonstrated that homelessness had a unique association with problems in classroom engagement, school mobility was uniquely related to both academic achievement and problems in classroom engagement, and experiencing both homelessness and school mobility was the most detrimental for both forms of educational well-being. Absenteeism was found to partially mediate the relations between homelessness, school mobility, and problems in task engagement. Results provide support for the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act and the need for educational policies for mobile children.",

Good science that identifies what causes homelessness, sound evaluations which document that certain programs will never work, and even evidence that promising solutions deserve broad replication, are often disregarded. Such wanton indifference for science would constitute malpractice in the field of medicine, but it sometimes passes as acceptable policy in the field of social welfare. Ideology, politics and preservation of the status quo usually prevail. So, whats a well intentioned researcher to do? Persevere and become more tactical. After all, policy failures cant be ignored forever. Like good advocates, researchers too have to be opportunistic. We have to find the right kind of audiences for our work, and perhaps even more importantly, we have to do the kind of work that will get us the right audiences.",

    "abstract": "Many Hispanic households in the United States face poor housing conditions, high rent burdens, overcrowding, andin some communitieshigh rates of homelessness. At the same time, awareness is growing that Hispanics are often underrepresented in housing and homelessness assistance programs relative to their poverty rate and compared with other groups with similar needs. This realization raises two immediate questions. First, to what extent are Hispanic households underrepresented in housing and homelessness programs across the country? Second, why is this the case? This article begins with a national analysis of Hispanic representation in federal housing subsidy programs and homeless shelter services at the county level. The authors test the relationship between a high degree of underrepresentation and county characteristics. The second part of the article presents a case study of Philadelphia using local program data, focus groups with residents, and direct interviews with 10 stakeholders to explore Hispanic Philadelphians housing experiences and barriers to participation in housing and homeless assistance programs. The data and methods employed in this article allow the authors to gain a better understanding of where and why low-income Hispanics do not access housing and homeless assistance and provide insight into how local and federal programs can be adjusted to better serve these growing needs.",

This is important, because we can begin to see discernable trends in homelessness, including the effects of the recession and of changes over time to the homeless services system. The 2009 AHAR also marks continued improvement in both sources of estimates of homelessness used in the reports. A larger number of communities are reporting Homeless Management Information System (HMIS) data to the AHAR, which is used in the analysis of patterns of homelessness over a years time. In 2009, 334 communitiesrepresenting 2,988 counties and 1,056 citiesreported usable HMIS data to the report, a sizable increase from last years report (222 communities). At the same time, the point-in-time (PIT) counts essential for estimating the numbers and characteristics of all homeless people, both sheltered and unsheltered, are improving as communities use more rigorous methodologies for conducting the counts.

The report also provides demographic information about people who transitioned from homelessnesseither sheltered or unshelteredto permanent supportive housing (PSH) and rapid rehousing (RRH) during this same one-year period.Key Findings: In 2018, an estimated 1,446,000 people in the U.S. experienced sheltered homelessness at some point during the year. Nearly two-thirds were in households with only adults. Thirty-five percent of people who experienced homelessness were in families with children. A small share (only one percent) were in child-only households. Black or African American people were considerably overrepresented among people experiencing homelessness. While representing 13 percent of all U.S. heads of households and 22 percent of heads of households living in poverty, people identifying as black accounted for 43 percent of heads of shelteredhouseholds in 2018. Nearly one in five heads of households and other adults using shelters had a chronic pattern of homelessness (18%). One in every ten sheltered adults was a veteran.",

Preventing and ending homelessness requires accurate information on the size and nature of the homelessness in the country, both at a point-in-time and on an annual basis. This report provides information onthe one-year estimates of people who were able to access shelter programs in both 2019 and 2020. Following the implementation of a new platform for collecting data from communities, 2019 has now become the baseline year for tracking changes in the numbers and characteristics of people who use shelter programs at some timeduring a year.The COVID-19 pandemic hit the United States in March 2020, affecting six months of the 2020 reporting year. Data presented in this report reflect the considerable disruptions to the homeless service system during this time. Some shelters were closed, and many others reduced the number of beds available for occupancy.Data presented in this report show that the total number of people using shelters declined between 2019 and 2020. This decline likely reflects reduced shelter capacity in some communities, as well as peoples reluctance to enter shelters because of health and safety concerns.",

    "abstract": "The number of people officially enumerated as living on the streets in Japan has been consistently decreasing since 2003. As of January 2020, there were 3 992 unsheltered people counted on a single night, which is about16% of the peak in 2003. In contrast, in the US 226 080 people were counted as unsheltered on a single night in 2020 and this number has been consistently increasing since 2015. This paper will focus on one cause of this difference, the respective public assistance systems in the US and Japan. The main public assistance system in Japan, Seikatsu-Hogo (Livelihood Protection) is argued to be a major factor driving the decline in the number of people living unsheltered there. But the characteristics of the Livelihood Protection programme that have contributed to this decline in street homelessness have not been examined in detail. We argue that three characteristics of Japans public assistance programme are at the core of its success in addressing street homelessness 1) generality, 2) comprehensiveness, and 3) expeditiousness. We also provide an overview of some important shortcomings of the programme. Clarifying how Japan has been able to reduce street homelessness provides insights for measures to address street homelessness in the US and other countries.",

The evaluation used the Rapid Assessment, Response, and Evaluation method to collect qualitative findings on service use barriers and facilitators from open-ended interviews with people staying in the encampments (N = 27) and service providers (N = 1 0). We assessed how the ERP allowed providers to \"push the system\" by removing access barriers, and providing amenable, effective, and accessible housing and drug treatment services that led to more widely adopted best practices. However, there was a clear need for additional supportive services and aftercare for those exiting treatment. Providers also cited a need for more integrated medical and mental health services.",

    "abstract": "This paper assesses the age composition of the sheltered homeless population and how the age of this population both single adults and adults in families have changed over the past two decades. Data for this study came from administrative records on shelter use in New York City and from the nationwide shelter and general population enumerations in each of the last two decennial census enumerations. Results are presented in a series of figures to illustrate 1) the changes in the age distributions of the homeless population over time; and 2) the age distribution of homeless populations compared to other populations. In the late 1980s, homeless single adults and adults in families were relatively young, with the median age for both being in the late-twenties. Subsequently, however, these household types appear to have diverged, as the birth cohort from which the young single adults had come (born 1954-1965) has continued to be overrepresented in the shelter population, whereas homelessness among adults in families has remained linked to households in the early parenting years (ages 18-23). While the families and the single adults may have experienced some common precipitating factors that led to the emergence of homelessness in the 1980s, the young mothers appear to age out of their risk for homelessness while homelessness among this birth cohort of single adults sustains. Hypotheses are discussed regarding the social and economic factors that may be associated with disproportionate housing instability and homelessness among adults from the latter half of the baby boom cohort. Implications for public policy are considered, including the premature risk of disability, frailty and mortality associated with this cohort.",

In the thirty years since homelessness first manifested itself in American cities in its contemporary form, it has ascended to one of the most prominent American social problems. Despite the current push by advocacy organizations to end homelessness, many expect it will always be with us. In its longevity, however, lies the potential for its decline, provided we do not repeat this cycle with a new generation of homeless.",

    "abstract": "STUDY OBJECTIVE: Administrative databases from the City of Philadelphia that track public shelter utilisation (n=44 337) and AIDS case reporting (n=7749) were merged to identify rates and risk factors for co-occurring homelessness and AIDS. DESIGN: Multiple decrement life tables analyses were conducted, and logistic regression analyses used to identify risk factors associated with AIDS among the homeless, and homelessness among people with AIDS. SETTING: City of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA. MAIN RESULTS: People admitted to public shelters had a three year rate of subsequent AIDS diagnosis of 1.8 per 100 person years; nine times the rate for the general population of Philadelphia. Logistic regression results show that substance abuse history (OR = 3.14), male gender (OR = 2.05), and a history of serious mental disorder (OR = 1.62) were significantly related to the risk for AIDS diagnosis among shelter users. Among people with AIDS, results show a three year rate of subsequent shelter admission of 6.9 per 100 person years, and a three year rate of prior shelter admission of 9%, three times the three year rate of shelter admission for the general population. Logistic regression results show that intravenous drug user history (OR = 3.14); no private insurance (OR = 2.93); black race (OR = 2.82); pulmonary or extra-pulmonary TB (OR = 1.43); and pneumocystis pneumonia (OR = 0.56) were all related to the risk for shelter admission. CONCLUSIONS: Homelessness prevention programmes should target people with HIV risk factors, and HIV prevention programmes should be targeted to homeless persons, as these populations have significant intersection. Reasons and implications for this intersection are discussed.",

    "abstract": "This paper discusses how researchers and others have analyzed the services histories of persons who have experienced homelessness, as well as their imputed costs. This research has been used both to make visible the ways in which the clients of mainstream social welfare systems (health, corrections, income maintenance and child welfare) become homeless and, complementarily, the impact of people who experience homelessness on the use of these service systems. Most published work in this area has been based on the integration of administrative databases to identify cases and service utilization patterns; some have used retrospective interviews. Results have been used to encourage agency administrators and policymakers to make investments in programs that reduce homelessness and/or the duration of homelessness periods. Quite recently, many local homeless services planning organizations in the US have used this approach to demonstrate the high costs of chronic homelessness and the potential cost offsets associated with the placement of people in supported housing. The opportunities and limitations associated with these various approaches, including their potential applicability to other countries and service sectors are discussed.",

Data were drawn from the 2010 Washington State Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, representative of the population of Washington State residents. Considering adults in households with children, those who experienced higher levels of childhood adversity were more likely to have experienced homelessness in adulthood. Meanwhile, a 10-factor index of cumulative developmental risk was independently associated with childhood adversity and with adult homelessness. Adult homelessness appears to represent a circumstance through which past childhood adversities are brought forward and associated with contexts of developmental risk for subsequent generations of children.",

Scattered-site public housing and units rented with Section 8 certificates and vouchers have slight negative impacts. Federal Housing Administrationassisted units, public housing homeownership program units, and Section 8 New Construction and Rehabilitation units have modest positive impacts.

Use of data from the Inventory of Mental Health Organizations (NIMH, 1983, 1986), revelaed that not-for-profits provide more services and serve more of the underinsured, while for-profits serve the better insured, concentrate primarily on inpatient services, and serve more children, adolescents, and substance abusers. A surplus bed capacity among for-profit psychiatric hospitals is presumed to contribute to lower occupancy rates and less turnover in the for-profit sector. Not-for-profit psychiatric facilities are also found to be more involved in professional training and to be more accessible through emergency services. However, the misclassification test in the discriminant procedure reveals that a significant group of not-for-profit facilities looks more like its for-profit counterpart group than like other not-for-profits. Study findings are interpreted both in terms of debates over the tax-exempt status of not-for-profit hospitals and the potential negative services effects of proprietization.",

Questionnaires were linked to administrative data using deterministic and probabilistic matching.Principal findings: Of 1993 ED patients who were not homeless at baseline, 5.6% entered a shelter in the next 6 months. A screening tool consisting of two measures of past shelter use and one of past criminal justice involvement had 83.0% sensitivity and 20.4% positive predictive value for future shelter entry.Conclusions: Our study demonstrates the potential of using cross-sector data to improve hospital initiatives to address patients' social needs.",

Building on this, we use data from New York City and from the last three decennial Census enumerations to assess how the age composition of the homeless populationboth single adults and adults in familieshas changed over time. Findings show diverging trends in aging patterns for single adults and adults in families over the past 20 years. Among single adults, the bulk of the sheltered population is comprised of persons born during the latter part of the baby boom era whose high risk for homelessness has continued as they have aged. Specifically, the age group in this population facing the highest risk for homelessness was 3436 (born 19541956) in 1990; 3742 (born 19581963) in 2000; and 4951 (born 19591961) in 2010. In contrast, among adults in sheltered families, there is no indication of any progressive aging of the family household heads. The modal age across the study period remains at 2123 years of age.

On January 30, 2020 the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the novel coronavirus outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International concern and on February 11, 2020 the WHO announced the name of the new coronavirus disease: COVID-19 (WHO, 2020). By mid-March, starting with California, in almost every state in the United States, persons were encouraged to shelter in place and to practice social distancing to flatten the growth curve of infection to allow hospitals and emergency health care resources to adequately keep pace with those experiencing acute medical crises (Baral et al., 2020). Asking citizens to shelter in place and practice social distancing created an unprecedented urgency for communities across the country to respond to the needs of persons experiencing homelessness in the face of this crisis (Doran et al., 2020; Lima et al., 2020; Tsai & Wilson, 2020).Primary concerns that quickly emerged across the nation were: How to provide shelter for people experiencing homelessness who become infected with COVID-19 How to provide adequate shelter to prevent COVID-19 infection among medically vulnerable persons experiencing homelessness (over 65, underlying health conditions) How to address shelter density in existing congregate shelters to comply with CDC guidance for social distancing in shelters (110 sq ft per person) How to address the health and safety of unsheltered persons including people in encampments, in light of the crisis; How to protect staff who serve persons experiencing homelessness How to acquire financial resources and PPE supplies to address the needs of people who are homeless How to coordinate screening, testing, tracking and contact tracing with community partners.

The purpose of this paper is threefold: First, it will present the conceptual framework for the IDS approach, describing how the IDS approach incorporates heuristic concepts from the major recent reform movements in public administration: performance management, continuous quality improvement, and evidence-based policymaking. Second, it will detail how these core features of the IDS approach are used to build a sustainable infrastructure to support a fully-functioning IDS for state and local government. Finally, the paper will illustrate how the IDS approach can be used as an effective and efficient vehicle to data-driven solutions through a close look at a single inquiry cycle and an overview of the larger systematic and iterative social problem-solving process within government.",

    "abstract": "The nation is now ten months into a national emergency caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. For homeless services systems, it has impacted temporary housing offerings, staffing, resources, and countless other areas. To understand these changes, the Alliance initiated the Voices from the Field project, which has included three national surveys, a series of interviews, and data collection from a small sampling of Continuums of Care (CoCs). The current report highlights the most recent survey (conducted in November) and some insights from the data collection efforts.The findings point to systems that quickly set up motel/hotel programs, most of which are still up and running as of November. Although survey respondents report expanding the availability of permanent housing, they also estimate that most clients leaving these quarantine/isolation rooms return to shelters and unsheltered locations. Frustration with this norm is causing CoC representatives to identify permanent housing as their number one priority for any new resources that become available. Other significant needs include staffing and growing existing motel/hotel efforts. If CoCs are unable to fund such items, they predict tragic consequences such as growth in unsheltered homelessness.",

    "abstract": "The impacts of COVID-19 on American life have been widespread. Not only is the virus a public health crisis but it is complicating efforts to recover from the current recession. In difficult times such as these, the most vulnerable people tend to endure the most significant hardships while being left behind on the road to recovery. Local homeless services providers play a crucial role in reducing the harm. Thus, the Alliance is tracking their progress in responding to the current moment.Alliance staff and research partners conducted an online survey of Continuum of Care (CoC) leaders in April, publishing the results in Community-level Responses of Homelessness Assistance Programs to COVID-19: Data from May 2020 and a supplementary policy brief. Alliance staff and researchers further explored the issues raised within a series of interviews. Responding to COVID-19: Conversations with Homeless System Leaders summarizes our discussions with a subset of survey respondents. Altogether, the findings suggested systems were overwhelmed by new responsibilities, a lack of available supplies, staffing shortages, and severe financial limitations.The current report reflects the findings of a second online survey of CoC leaders, and notes note progress in areas such as access to personal protective equipment (PPE), screening, and testing. However, there continue to be challenges as systems simultaneously juggle the pressures to 1) respond to public health needs, 2) maintain system functioning, and 3) continue to make progress on the goal of reducing homelessness.",

We examine these disparities using administrative data from public health agencies, utility companies, and primary data collected from hundreds of Pennsylvanians through surveys and focus groups.We find that a breadth of vulnerabilities faced by all Pennsylvania residents are particularly acute for racial and ethnic minorities. Low-income, Black, and Latinx residents are more likely to be rent-burdened and pay more money toward their utility bills than their counterparts. They are also more likely to experience utility insecurity. Areas with higher concentrations of minority residents have much higher rates of utility arrears and disconnections as well as much higher rates of enrollment in utility assistance programs. In addition, roughly three-quarters of Black and Latinx survey respondents reported falling behind on rent or mortgage paymentssince March, and one-third of Black residents reported being either formally or informally evicted and were the most likely to worry about future evictions and utility shutoffs. We also found that communities with higher non-white shares of the population were hit hardest by the coronavirus, especially in the early months. The relationship between virus prevalence and race became less pronounced as the virus became more ubiquitous through the fall and winter.",

Most reforms have focused on reducing the capacity of the shelter system by reducing the average length of stay of persons in shelter and by providing housing relocation assistance. However, these reforms have been compromised by an inability to contol the demand for shelter, particularly the rate of new admissions , and by the extent of need for housing assistance among homeless and near-homeless people in Philadelphia. Alternative methods of financing shelters are described, as are attempts to create a system of specialty shelter providers. The contradictions of shelter reform and the need for a more comprehensive homelessness prevention strategy are discussed.",

Two cohorts of young adults from both systems were selected for analysis. Within the two cohorts, this study focuses on three groups of youth exiters: (i) The child welfare (CW) group is comprised of youth who exited from a child welfare out-of-home placement between the ages of 16 and 21; (ii) the juvenile probation (JP) group is made up of youth who exited from any type of juvenile probation supervision between the ages of 16 and 21; and (iii) the crossover group is comprised of all youth who exited an out-of-home child welfare placement between the ages of 16 and 21 and who also had a record of nvolvement with the juvenile probation system. The adult outcomes of youth in each of these three groups are analyzed by linking their administrative records from Los Angeles Countys Department of Children and Family Services (DCFS) and/or Probation Department with administrative databases from seven County departments providing an array of public services to residents of Los Angeles County, as well as from two California statewide agencies. Results indicate high levels of correctional system and public assistance involvement across the study groups, with particularly high rates of utilization among crossover youth. Patterns of health and behavioral health services use follow a similar pattern. Imputed costs by group and by service sector are reported. Educational attainment and reported income are also documented. Regression analyses examine independent predictors of various outcomes by study group.",

Second, we seek to better understand possible dynamics that might contribute to such a paradox through conducting focus groups with service providers, clients and city agency and nonprofit staff. Lastly, we consider recent efforts to address homelessness through improved evidence-based practices, in both a national and local context, and consider how these efforts could better assist Latinx adults and families facing imminent homelessness in resolving or avoiding homelessness in the near future.",

    "abstract": "The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) is pleased to present this second national report to Congress on homelessness in America. The first Annual Homeless Assessment Report (AHAR) was submitted in February 2007. These reports were developed in response to a series of Congressional directives beginning with the FY 2001 HUD Appropriations Act. In that year, Congress directed the Department to assist communities to implement local Homeless Management Information Systems (HMIS) and required every jurisdiction to have client-level reporting within three years. Senate Report 106-410 noted that HMIS data could be used to develop an unduplicated count of homeless people and to analyze the use and effectiveness of homeless assistance services. To that end, Congress further charged the Department with collecting and analyzing HMIS data from a representative sample of communities in order to understand the nature and extent of homelessness nationally. The second AHAR makes use of two primary data sources. The first source is HMIS data on the number, characteristics, and patterns of shelter use among sheltered homeless persons - or persons who used emergency and transitional housingduring a six-month period from January 1 through June 30, 2006. The data were obtained from a nationally representative sample of communities. A total of 58 sample sites participated in the second AHAR, including 49 communities that participated in the first AHAR and 9 new sample communities that were not able to provide data for the first report. Because some sample communities are still working to secure the participation of homeless assistance providers in HMIS, not all could provide data for this analysis (or could provide only partial data). As a result, the estimates provided in this report have large confidence intervals (i.e., sampling error).",

    "abstract": "This research asked 86 people who had been homeless for at least 90 days about the services they had used.

Estimated public spending on the 86 people for 90 days was 742,141 in total and 8,630 on average. If the 86 people had been homeless for one year with the same pattern of service use, estimated public spending would be 34,518 on average per person per year, a total of some 2.96 million annually. For a single homeless population of 40,000, if estimated costs were at the average level, annual public expenditure would be some 1.38 billion.This report also uses the available data to estimate the changes in service use that would occur, if someone were not homeless - because their homelessness was prevented - compared to the costs that arose because they were homeless. On average, it was estimated that preventing homelessness for one year would result in a reduction in public expenditure of 9,266 per person.

Identifiers and service records from longitudinal databases on shelter and mental health services were merged, finding that 49% of single homeless adults and 33.2% of homeless adults with children had a treatment for a mental health or substance use disorder between 1985 and 1993. The rate of treatment for serious mental illness (SMI) was 10.7% (by most frequently occurring diagnosis). Single women (18.6%) had twice the rate of SMI as single men (9.9%), and single adults (12.1%) had twice the rate of SMI as adults with children (6.2%). The treate rate of substance use disorders (25.2%) was higher than the rate of mental health disorders (20%), and was twice as high for single adults (28.6%) as for adults with children (14.6%). An additional 20% of adult shelter users were identified through shelter records as having untreated substance use problems. Veterans had comparable rates of disorders as nonveterans. Oveall, 65% of adult shelter users were identified as ever having some mental health or substance use problem, treated or untreated. People with SMI were less represented among shelter users on two single day censuses than over three years, suggesting a higher rate of turnover among people with SMI, while people with substance use disorders were overrepresented by a third on the two single day censuses, suggesting a lower rate of turnover among people treated for sugbstance abuse. Of the treated Medicaid population, 6.8% became homeless in the three year study period, representing 7.8% of the treated population with SMI, 9.5% of the treated schizophrenia population, and 20.1% of the population receiving inpatient substance abuse services. Approximately 3,000 people with SMI became homeless in the 3-year study period, with an average of 73 people with SMI entering shelter for the first time each month. An analysis of inpatient usage found that 25.7% of the SMI and 34.2% of the treated substance abuse population were hospitalized within 120 days of their first shelter admission (before or after). Fourteen percent of the SMI were also seen in an emergency room within 120 days of shelter admission (before or after).",

    "abstract": "A group of international researchers with experience of strategic analysis of homelessness policy, practice and service programmes were asked to review the effects of the Rebuilding Ireland strategy on the level and nature of Irish homelessness. The review took the stance of a critical friend, drawing on possible lessons from practice elsewhere in Europe and in North America.The review included discussions and consultations with stakeholders in the design and delivery of homelessness policy and services and with people with lived experience of homelessness, who were asked about the issues they thought were most important in reducing homelessness in Ireland. Irish views on strengths and limitations were identified through these discussions, which were then used to structure the wider analysis in this review, drawing on possibly beneficial practice from other countries and avoiding some of the problems other countries had encountered. The review did not consider the specific questions arising around migrant groups who are ineligible to join housing lists.Homelessness was seen as being defined in a relatively narrow way, i.e. focusing on people sleeping rough and the number and duration of stays in emergency accommodation. This was seen as neglecting hidden homelessness and by extension, not fully recognising and not fully responding to the true nature of homelessness in Ireland. While some measures had fallen, experience of homelessness remained more common than had been the case. Existing measures were also thought to highlight urban homelessness.Womens experience of homelessness tends to be significantly underestimated when enumeration does not include an attempt to count hidden homelessness. The most effective, integrated strategies, including practice in Scotland and Finland, use a wide definition of homelessness which facilitates a more comprehensive array of prevention, rapid rehousing and housing-led, Housing First and supported housing services and cross referral of a broadly defined at risk population across wider health, criminal justice and social protection systems.Affordable and social housing supply were thought to be at the core of homelessness causation and the limitations of existing policy in preventing and ending homelessness. Services like Housing First were hampered, as was any service within a housing-led framework as soon as adequate, affordable housing with reasonable security of tenure was in short supply. Progress was noted in addressing these issues, but more social and affordable housing was needed. People with lived experience of homelessness reported that only social housing offered the affordability, standards and security of tenure that enabled a sustained exit from homelessness.Internationally, no level of coordination, evidence-led practice or comprehensiveness of response has been found that counteracts the effects of insufficient affordable, adequate homes with security of tenure. Prevention, housing-led and Housing First services, alongside the integration of health, mental health, addiction, criminal justice and welfare systems in a homelessness strategy will either be limited, or fail, if there are not enough suitable homes with which to prevent and end homelessness.Progress has been made in homelessness prevention in Ireland, although with the caveat that the ongoing issues with inadequate housing supply limit overall effectiveness. There are lessons from comprehensive preventative systems used in other countries, such as that developed in Wales, which define and respond to homelessness on a broad basis and appear to reach much of the population who are at risk of homelessness.Housing First has become a significant part of the policy response to homelessness. Systems are at their most developed in Dublin and other urban areas, with reports of more uneven coverage in some more rural areas. Internationally, the key lesson appears to be that Housing First delivered through a coherent, comprehensive and well-resourced strategy achieves both better coverage and more consistent results. Something to avoid is the rather haphazard development of many small scale projects, which while they may show success, are not part of a coherent, properly resourced national plan, leading to inconsistencies in coverage and results, as seen in England, Italy and Sweden.The needs of women, which are distinct, in the sense that their homelessness is much more closely associated with domestic abuse (much family homelessness is women lone parents and dependent children at risk of domestic abuse) and they are more likely to avoid (often male dominated) services and use informal arrangements with family, friends or acquaintances (hidden homelessness). With some exceptions in terms of women-only, housing-led and Housing First services, much service provision is still built on an assumption that homelessness is mainly experienced by lone men. This is not specific to Ireland, greater recognition of womens needs and experiences and the extent of their homelessness is a pan-EU issue.North West European and North American countries tend to recognise young people, including care leavers (young adults who have been in care of social work/child protection services) as having specific needs when they experience homelessness, centring on their youth, adverse childhood experiences and associated vulnerability. This is an area that could be the subject of more detailed policy consideration in Ireland.Coordination of services and information about those services were reported as inconsistent and as in need of improvement by people with lived experience of homelessness. The standardisation of responses seen in strategies like that of Finland or the (distinct) legislative frameworks of Scotland and Wales may be useful in addressing this issue.The review has drawn together key lessons from international experience that may be of use as the new strategy Housing for All is implemented, these include:Recognising that a broader definition of homelessness can be the gateway to building a more comprehensive, effective strategic response.Prevention, housing-led and Housing First services are most effective when part of an integrated, interagency homelessness strategy because they depend on cross referral to an array of other services.Implementation must be comprehensive if a strategy is to work and this means that governance must be clear, focused and stable, ensuring that coherent strategy steadily builds in effectiveness over time.",

    "abstract": "Findings from Year 4 show that, for the third consecutive year, over 20,000 people experiencing homelessness exited homeless services to Permanent Housing (PH) placements (macro-measure 2). Nearly 10,000 of these PH placements occurred within the purview of HI-supported initiatives (meso-measure 3). Looking at these PH placements over the last three years, 56,000 unduplicated people exited shelter stays to PH (both HI- and non-HI-funded), and 31,000 of these exits came under the auspices of HI-supported services.Noteworthy also were Interim Housing (IH) placements, which declined 25% after significant year-over-year growth since FY 2016-17. Building IH capacity is a key component of reducing LAs large unsheltered population, and the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the resulting need to decompress shelter facilities, has handed these efforts an additional challenge. The reduction in IH housing capacity in Year 4 is one of the first indicators of COVID-19s impact on LAs homeless services, and COVID-19 will almost certainly have a much larger impact on HI strategies in the upcoming Year 5. In addition, the rental unit vacancies in LA has been very low over the past couple of years making permanent housing opportunities harder to secure. This has made the IH lengths of stay longer, thus reducing the number of IH beds that turn over.",

    "abstract": "As has been the practice in all four previous HI annual performance evaluations, the main body of this report begins at a macro level of measurement in Section 2, where the performance of Measure Hfunded HI strategies and services unaffiliated with the HI strategies are examined together to offer a systemwide perspective. The analysis then moves down to the program or meso-level in Section 3, separately exploring HI strategy outcomes aggregated into broader categories, the three most important of which are permanent housing (PH), interim housing (IH), and prevention. This separate analysis of the HI strategies as a collective program enables their performance to be gauged against comparable non-HI service categories while also establishing a basis for measuring the HIs contribution to systemwide performance. Appendix A provides the performance measurements at the level of individual strategies. In addition, Section 4 provides an assessment of the Los Angeles Homeless Services Authoritys (LAHSAs) recent Point-in-Time (PIT) homeless counts informed by a homeless services systems through-flow analysis, and Section 5 provides a pre/post evaluation of health, mental health and jail outcomes for households placed by HI.",

    "abstract": "The District of Columbia shelter system currently operates on a continuum of care model that assumes all or most people with housing emergencies should enter shelters and move progressively through a series of fully subsidized residential programs, then on to independence. The federal government encouraged the development of this model, and it is one that predominates nationally. This approach, however, is inflexible and has relatively high fixed unit costs because it assumes that all homeless people, regardless of the nature of their housing emergency, should enter a system of supervised residential programs. In fact, not all segments of the homeless population require the extensive social services necessary to help chronically homeless persons. States and localities recognize that not everyone should enter the shelter system, and have increasingly looked to alternative methods to divert families and individuals from shelters. Typically they combine rigorous needs assessment with emergency housing assistance-such as time-limited rent subsidies, rent arrears assistance, relocation grants, utility assistance, or loans and often supplement such financial assistance with case management and/or referral to community programs. Homelessness prevention programs target the nearly homeless - those who with assistance can overcome an acute housing crisis and avoid a shelter stay - and generally are delivered in a neighborhood context. Unfortunately, federal funds for homelessness cannot currently be used for such activity.",

We used prior address information reported by families entering emergency shelters in two large U.S. cities to characterize the nature of that distribution.Three dense clusters of homeless origins were found in Philadelphia and three in New York City, accounting for 67 percent and 61 percent of shelter admissions and revealing that homeless families prior addresses are more highly concentrated than the poverty distribution in both cities. The rate of shelter admission is strongly and positively related to the concentration of poor, African-American, and female-headed households with young children in a neighborhood. It is also correlated with fewer youth, elderly, and immigrants. Such areas have higher rates of unemployment and labor force nonparticipation, more housing crowding, more abandonment, higher rates of vacancy, and higher rent-to-income ratios than other areas.",

    "abstract": "Equity assessments, like those described in this working paper, have historical roots in the Civil Rights movement. As part of demands for equitable access to jobs, resources, and services, communities of color and Civil Rights advocates pressed public and private institutions to document the representation of racial and ethnic groups (National Archives, 2016). Corrective action plans were used to develop clear strategies to redress inequities and hold institutions accountable to change. Affirmative action policies reinforced these strategies by requiring certain groups, such as federal contractors, to develop numerical targets and timelines to correct for underutilization of services by marginalized groups (Legal Information Institute, n.d.).Human service agencies are now being called upon once again to address inequities within their programs. In January 2021, President Biden signed the Executive Order on Advancing Racial Equity and Support for Underserved Communities Through the Federal Government, which requires federal agencies to identify methods for assessing equity within federal programs and to engage communities historically underserved or discriminated against in these programs (Exec. Order No. 13985, 2021). This working paper strives to build upon the aims of the Civil Rights movement to help human service agencies estimate and respond to racial and ethnic inequities in their service provision. The urgency of this work is underscored not only by the executive order, but also by the long overdue social unrest around racialized violence and inequity in the U.S. and the stark racial disparities in experience and outcomes of the COVID-19 pandemic.The following sections of this paper outline three phases of workperforming a gaps analysis (measuring gaps between need for and current availability of services), interpreting the gaps analysis (assessing root causes of the problem and strategizing responses), and co-creating an equity plan (determining next steps and implementing strategies to correct for inequities). Importantly, community organizations and those with lived experiences of the systems under consideration need to be engaged throughout this entire process. See AToolkit for Centering Racial Equity Throughout Data Integration for more (Hawn Nelson et al., 2020a). In addition, the general process provided here will need to be customized based on the social issue of interest, local context, available data, and resource constraints. Drawing upon multiple data sources, types of expertise, and stakeholder perspectives is highly recommended in order to robustly assess and respond to inequities in service provision. Altogether, these methods can inform social policymaking and support human serviceagencies in more equitable resource allocation and service provision.",

    "abstract": "The economic and social impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic have heightened demand for cross-agency data capacity, as policymakers are forced to reconcile the need for expanded services with extreme fiscal constraints. In this context, integrated data systems (IDS) also commonly referred to as data hubs, data collaboratives, or state longitudinal data systems are a valuable resource for data-informed decision making across agencies. IDS utilize standard governance processes and legal agreements to grant authority for routine, responsible use of linked data, and institutionalize roles across partners with shared priorities. Despite these benefits, creating and sustaining IDS remains a challenge for many states. Legislation and executive action can be powerful mechanisms to overcome this challenge and promote the use of cross-agency data for public good.This brief is organized in three parts. First, we offer examples of approaches from states that have used legislation and/or executive orders to enable data integration, as well as key considerations related to each. Second, we discuss state and federal funding opportunities that can help in implementing legislative or executive actions on data sharing and enhancing long-term sustainability of data sharing efforts. Third, we offer five foundational strategies to ensure that legislative or executive action is both ethical and effective.",

    "abstract": "Older adult homelessness is increasing in the US. Research published more than a decade ago using 1990 to 2010 decennial Census data suggested this is due to a birth cohort effect. Persons born between 1955 and 1965 have composed a disproportionate share of the single adult homeless population since the 1980s. We have thus far lacked information about whether this trend has persisted since 2010.

    "abstract": "Hurricane Ike made landfall in the Galveston Bay Area in 2008, destroying parts of the built and natural environment, and leaving survivors with a high prevalence of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD); however, equally striking was the rapid decline of PTSD among survivors during the 18 months following this disaster. Existing literature suggests that social support tends to either directly or indirectly mitigate such mental health outcomes by moderating disaster-related stress. The present article builds on this to analyze the possible factors contributing to PTSD recovery, including both Ike-related stress suffered by victims and the social support they received over time. We used the Galveston Bay Recovery Study public use file, which includes three waves of interviews for selected victims (n = 658) and employed a series of nested random-effect logistic regression models to test two hypotheses: (a) that social support received by victims buffered the positive relationship between Ike-related stress and PTSD risk and (b) that this buffering effect (BE) diminished over time. Our results provide strong evidence for such BEs ( = 0.03, p = .009), and, through the use of three-way interaction analysis corrected for multiple testing, we show that the observed BE did indeed diminish over time (p = .045). PTSD resulting from disaster-related stress can be substantially reduced by social support interventions. Policy formulation should focus on early social support interventions, given they are most effective in PTSD recovery.",

    "abstract": "Integrating the Transtheoretical Model with Social Cognitive Theory and Protection Motivation Theory, we propose a new model to study the progress of behavior changes towards disaster preparedness along three developmental stages: from not prepared (NP), to intention to prepare (IP), to already prepared (AP). Using the 2021 National Household Survey data (FEMA, N = 6,180), we tested this model by employing a series of nested weighted generalized ordered logistic regressions. We found that, although Hispanics have a larger prevalence of IP than their non-Hispanic white counterparts, they are less likely to move to the AP stage. The observed ethnic disparity is largely due to the disparities in actual behavioral capabilities in essential knowledge and access to resources between the two groups. Personal disaster experience, social/observational learning, self-efficacy, and risk perception each facilitate behavior changes from the NP to IP or AP stage (i.e., departure from NP stage) and from NP or IP stage to AP stage (i.e., arrival at AP stage). Although income does not necessarily influence one's decision to depart from the NP stage, it determines one's arrival at the AP stage. Increasing one's income further boosts the realization of AP for people with high-risk perceptions. However, for people with moderate or low levels of risk perceptions, increased income did not lead to arrival at the AP stage. Additional research is needed to more fully apply this process-oriented approach with new measurement introduced in this paper to study the behavior changes among subpopulations in exposure to specific hazards.",

In response, FEMA provides Transitional Sheltering Assistance (TSA) to victims of housing loss. However, the extent to which sheltering needs are met by TSA has not been investigated, especially among low-income households. Analyzing FEMAs administrative data including all damaged housing units in Harris and Galveston counties (N = 283,085), we found that low-income victims of housing loss not only had greater sheltering needs but also were less likely to access TSA than their counterparts not of low-income status. When both groups were in need of shelter, the chance of obtaining TSA for low-income victims of housing loss was much lower than that for their counterparts. Our study highlights the critical sheltering needs of low-income households in a natural disaster, and advocates for a broader and more equitable distribution of TSA.",

    "abstract": "With nearly 30 trillion tons of raining water, Hurricane Harvey wreaked havoc on the Texas Coast, with two-thirds of its flooded residential buildings clustered in Houston-Galveston area alone. Victims of housing loss after disasters are usually in immediate need of emergency shelters (Quarantelli, 1995); and low-income urban residents are at risk of becoming chronically homeless if they lack access to assistance with relocating into conventional housing (Culhane, Metraux, and Byrne, 2014). In response, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) provides Transitional Sheltering Assistance (TSA), which for Hurricane Harvey came at a cost of $441 million. However, to what extent the shelter and housing needs were met by TSA, especially among those in low-income households, has not been investigated. Focusing on Harvey-damaged primary housing units in Harris and Galveston counties, our study interrogates two research questions:1.What was the extent of sheltering need among housing loss victims by different income levels?2.To what extent did the TSA program address the sheltering needs of housing loss victims with different income levels?",

Most of these students families lived doubled up with another family, while nearly one third resided in shelter. Students in such circumstances face enormous challenges to learning, contributing to a vicious cycle of poverty, homelessness, and educational underattainment which can be devastating to students and their families.New York City has implemented a multifaceted response to support those at risk of homelessness. Specifically, the Department of the Human Resources Administration and Social Services (HRA/DSS) operates homeless prevention programs that provide services to households identified as at-risk and who, without an intervention, might experience homelessness. Despite providing services to many families at risk of homelessness and preventing homelessness, the risk pool is often so large that most families with risk factors for homelessness never enter shelter or ever experience homelessness. This situation makes identifying families who will become homeless in the absence of an intervention critically important.This report presents findings from research designed to identify risk factors and produce a new predictive model to help school staff identify students at the highest risk of imminent homelessness. The report starts by summarizing prior efforts to target homelessness prevention programs. Then, the report describes factors that are known to be associated with student homelessness. After this background, the report describes the methods, key findings, and implications of the analysis.

This chapter explores the ways in which the United States moved from definitions and counts focused on street homelessness to much wider and more comprehensive definitions and new ways of finding and accurately counting people experiencing homelessness. This has included the use of increasingly refined PIT (point-in-time) methods. The importance of common administrative systems and data sharing in understanding the nature and extent of homelessness and the characteristics of people experiencing homelessness is also examined. The progress in measurement is considered in relation to some ongoing challenges in measurement. Difficulties still exist in reliably finding populations who can be hidden from standard survey methods, have infrequent contact with administrative systems, and can sometimes be highly mobile.",

We then adopted a series of logistic regression models to estimate the probabilities of having GAD by sequentially adding these possible explanatory factors.Results: Findings demonstrated higher prevalence rates of GAD among Hispanic and non-Hispanic Black Americans than non-Hispanic White Americans, which can primarily be attributed to the fact that non-Hispanic White Americans were less vulnerable to job loss and food insecurity. Older adults were less susceptible to GAD than their middle-aged and young adult counterparts. Compared to unvaccinated older adults, the odds of having GAD were substantially reduced for older adults who were partially vaccinated, and even more significantly declined for fully vaccinated older adults.Discussion: Racial and ethnic disparities in GAD were largely due to disproportionate experiences of job loss and food insecurity across different racial and ethnic groups during the pandemic. Social distancing measures partially explain the different prevalence of GAD between older adults and their counterparts. Rapid deployment of the COVID-19 vaccines played an effective role in suppressing GAD, especially among older adults.",

The results indicate that a substantial majority of homeless families stay in public shelters for relatively brief periods, exit, and do not return. Approximately 20 percent stay for long periods. A small but noteworthy proportion cycles in and out of shelters repeatedly. In general, families with long stays are no more likely than families with short stays to have intensive behavioral health treatment histories, to be disabled, or to be unemployed. Families with repeat stays have the highest rates of intensive behavioral health treatment, placement of children in foster care, disability, and unemployment. The results suggest that policy and program factors, rather than family characteristics, are responsible for long shelter stays.

Results show that inpatient and foster care services use drops in the homelessness period, but rebounds following exit, regardless of pattern of shelter use, and type of housing exit. Results suggest that shelters supplant use of services, but not on a sustained basis. Despite declines in concurrent services use, the homelessness period is overall more costly for episodically and long-term shelter users, primarily owing to the high costs of shelter. High rates of inpatient and foster care services use following the homeless spell suggest that providers of homeless assistance should systematically screen and refer homeless families to on-going community-based service supports. Service use patterns indicate that homeless spells may disrupt continuity of care with community-based health and social services.",

However, programs operating under the Housing First model do not receive the necessary funding to meet the needs of all people experiencing homelessness.The estimated gaps and costs are hypothetical for a few important reasons: they do not include the needs of exclusively unsheltered households in 2022; the estimates are for a single year, so they do not consider multi-year costs; and the estimates do not account for varying assumptions regarding self-resolution or other potential program exits and geographic differences in program costs and affordable housing supply. Concerns about program quality improvements and consistent fidelity to the Housing First approach should also be a focus of future research and analysis.In 2022, homeless response systems only had the capacity to place 16.0% of households who were served in the nations shelters into permanent housing. Housing everyone who experiences sheltered homelessness during a given year would be a substantial step forward in ending homelessness.In this study, we ask: What would it cost to provide a Housing First placement to every household staying in a homeless shelter throughout the United States?We conservatively estimate that an additional $9.6 billion would be needed to achieve this goal: providing Rapid Re-Housing or Permanent Supportive Housing to everyone in a homeless shelter unable to access housing in a single year.Our analysis uses the most recently available Annual Homelessness Assessment Report (AHAR) Part 2, Supportive Services for Veteran Families (SSVF) Annual Report, and U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Homeless Programs Office data to estimate program placement rates, unmet need, and funding required to house every adult, family, and veteran household that stayed in a shelter in 2022.",
