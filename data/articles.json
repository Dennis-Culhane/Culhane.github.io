    "abstract": "On July 22, 2003 (68 FR 43430), HUD published a draft Notice that described the data and technical standards for implementing Homeless Management Information Systems, HMIS. An HMIS is a computerized data collection application that facilitates the collection of information on homeless individuals and families using residential or other homeless assistance services and stores that data in an electronic format. Because an HMIS has the capacity to integrate data from all homeless service providers in the community and to capture basic descriptive information on every person served, it is a valuable resource for communities. HMIS can be employed to: better understand the characteristics of homeless persons in the community, including their demographic characteristics, patterns of homelessness, and use of services; improve the delivery of housing and services to specific sub-populations such as veterans or persons experiencing chronic homelessness; and assess and document the communitys progress in reducing homelessness.",

    "abstract": "Objective: Homelessness and patterns of service use were examined among seriously mentally ill persons in an area with a well-funded community- based mental health system. Methods: The sample consisted of 438 individuals referred between 1990 and 1992 to an extended acute care psychiatric hospital after a stay in a general hospital. Those experiencing an episode of homelessness, defined as an admission to a public shelter between 1990 and 1993, were compared with those who were residentially stable. Data from a longitudinal integrated database of public mental health and medical services were used to construct service utilization measures to test the mediating effect of outpatient mental health care on preventing homelessness. Results: A homelessness rate of 24 percent was found among the 438 persons with serious mental illness. Those who experienced homelessness were more likely to be African American, receive general assistance, and have a comorbid substance abuse problem. They used significantly more inpatient psychiatric, emergency, and health care services than the subjects who did not become homeless. Forty to 50 percent of the homeless group received outpatient care during the year before and after their shelter episode. The number of persons who received intensive case management services increased after shelter admission. Conclusions: An enhanced community-based mental health system was not sufficient to prevent homelessness among high-risk persons with serious mental illness. Eleven percent of this group experienced homelessness after referral to an extended acute care facility. Strategies to prevent homelessness should be considered, perhaps at the time of discharge from the referring community hospital or extended acute care facility.",

Results showed that 16% of the study group experienced homelessness at some point during the study, and that homelessness was significantly associated with a higher likelihood of frequenting shooting galleries (odds ratio = 2.05), but did not have a significant effect on sharing syringes, sharing other injection drug paraphernalia, or participating in paid sex.

Our framework integrates structural forcessuch as income inequality, an affordable housing shortage, social exclusion, and inadequate safety net programswith the personal circumstances and challenges that shape individuals homeless trajectories. The macro-micro perspective also helps us to evaluate the effectiveness of policies, and it highlights variation across contexts in how the dynamics of homelessness operate. In a separate section, we introduce the sixteen core articles of this volume against the macro-micro backdrop. Finally, we discuss two emergent macro shocks (the COVID-19 pandemic and climate-related hazards) that are largely absent from the volume but carry important implications for understanding and addressing homelessness in the future.",

A demonstration project initiated in 2010 to reform housing placement practices in a metropolitan area enabled researchers to compare an explicit Housing First programoffering immediate permanent housing without requiring treatment compliance, abstinence, or housing readinesswith a treatment-first program for 177 homeless Veterans. The Housing First initiative successfully reduced time to housing placement, from 223 to 35 days, housing retention rates were significantly higher among Housing First tenants, and emergency room use declined significantly among the Housing First cohort. The results suggest that a national Housing First model for the VA would be associated with improved outcomes for Veterans experiencing homelessness.",

However, the extent to which this relationship prevents homelessness has not been fully explored. This article looks at the effectiveness of outpatient services delivered to people within thirty days of discharge from psychiatric hospitalization. The sample consisted of homeless adults with mental illness, and the study assessed the reoccurrence of homelessness following hospital discharge. Prompt connection with aftercare services was effective in reducing homelessness for people who used the shelter system a single time in the year prior to their psychiatric hospitallization. For repeated users of the shelter system, the recurrence of homelessness was not correlated with timely outpatient services following hospital discharge. The study suggests that continuity of care is instrumental in prevent future homelessness among a portion of the homeless mentally ill population. For homeless mentally ill people with recent histories of repeated shelter use, greater diversity and intensity of outpatient services are necessary.",

We adjusted odds ratios for confounding variables.Results.

Among gun assaults where the victim had at least some chance to resist, this adjustedodds ratio increased to 5.45 (P<.05).Conclusions. On average, guns did not protect those who possessed them from being shot in an assault.

However, the homeless assistance systems in most countries are not adequately resourced to assist persons experiencing crisis homelessness, who account for the majority of the homeless population. Thus, we present a policy proposal for leveraging an expansion of Critical Time Intervention (CTI), an evidence-based behavioral health intervention, as a scalable solution for crisis homelessness. We draw on the specific policy context of the United States in proposing the use of funds from Medicaid, the public health insurance program for low-income individuals, to finance such an expansion, but argue our broader policy proposal has salience internationally as well. In presenting our proposal, we discuss why it represents a sound and feasible policy idea, focusing on the alignment between CTI and a promising new programmatic approach known as rapid rehousing. We describe the potential benefits of enacting this proposal and conclude with discussing the United States-specific and more general challenges that would need to be addressed to implement it, including the need for additional resources to cover the costs of the temporary financial assistance component of rapid re-housing.",

However, none of these advances guarantees that organization staff will be able to make sense of these mountains of data. Perhaps more important, the advances do not enhance access to the most useful types of data that frequently reside behind municipal agency firewalls and layers of bureaucratic red tape. The growing demand for small-area administrative data in useful formats makes essential the development of new tools to support a wide range of community change efforts.",

Administrative dataare data collected during the routine process of administering programs, but can also be repurposed to support evaluation, analysis, and research. This resource is designed to help partnerships, collaboratives, agencies, and community initiatives enter into that process of repurposing administrative data thoughtfully and of building the capacity to do so routinely with strong governance in place. We generally refer to these efforts as integrated data systems (IDS), but they have other names, including data hubs, data collaboratives, and data intermediaries.Whatever they are called, all efforts that seek to leverage shared data to improve individual and community outcomes will likely face common ethical, relational, legal, and technical considerations. This introductory document outlines some of those considerations and provides recommended resources and references for those interested in diving deeper.",

Nearly three-quarters of the chronically homeless adults in this study with incomes below the threshold for the Medicaid expansion were not enrolled in Medicaid. Fifty-three percent were uninsured or relied solely on state or local assistance, and 21 percent had other coverage that included Department of Veterans Affairs health care. The findings on differences in health status and service use across groups suggest that the Medicaid expansion offers important opportunities to increase coverage and access to care for chronically homeless adults. There may be potential savings for states that expand Medicaid, as people transition from state and local assistance to more comprehensive services under Medicaid. Targeted outreach and assistance to enroll eligible homeless people will be necessary. A broad range of physical and mental health services will be required, including case management to coordinate services.",

This fact has not gone unnoticed by researchers, who have made numerous attempts to identify the underlying structural determinants of homelessness by modeling inter-community variation in the rate of homelessness as a function of community-level variables. Yet, prior studies in this area have a number of serious limitations, principally their reliance on methodologically flawed estimates of the size of the homeless population. The present study addresses this and other limitations by using newly available and more reliable estimates from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development to model variation in the rate of homelessness across a large and diverse sample of communities throughout the United States. In doing so, this study builds on the analysis conducted by Lee, Price-Spratlen, and Kanan (2003), and its findings have implications for policy and future research.",

Adults who are homeless have a much reduced life expectancy compared to their housed peers, and can expect to live to a mere 64 years.

Survival analyses reveal that half of adult shelter users will stay fewer than 45 days over a two-year period (combined stays), and that approximately one half of men and one third of women will experience a readmission within two years of the first admission. Results also document the size and relative resource consumption of a long-term sheltered population, finding that 18.2 percent of New York shelter users stay 180 days or more in their first yea6 consuming 53.4 percent of the system days for first-time shelter users. Discrete-time logistic hazard regression analyses reveal that, in general, being older, of black race, having a substance abuse or mental health problem, or having a physical disability, significantly reduces the likelihood of exiting shelter. In both cities, people entering shelter in later years are staying longer, although individuals have shorter episodes on subsequent admissions.

Data were analyzed from September 2019 through October 2021. EXPOSURES Responses on patient surveys conducted at the baseline ED visit for 2 single-item screening questions on self-perceived risk for future housing instability and homelessness were collected. One question asked patients if they were worried about having stable housing in the next 2 months, and the other question asked them to rate the likelihood that they would enter a homeless shelter in the next 6 months. OUTCOMES Homeless shelter entry 2, 6, and 12 months after an ED visit, assessed using shelter administrative data in the study city, which was linked with participant baseline survey responses. RESULTS There were 1919 study participants (976 [51.0%] men and 931 [48.6%] women among 1915 individuals with gender data; 700 individuals aged 31-50 years [36.5%] among 1918 individuals with age data; 1126 Hispanic or Latinx individuals [59.0%], 368 non-Hispanic Black individuals [19.3%], and 225 non-Hispanic White individuals [11.8%] among 1908 individuals with race and ethnicity data). Within 2, 6, and 12 months of the ED visit, 45 patients (2.3%), 66 patients (3.4%), and 95 patients (5.0%) had entered shelter, respectively. For both single-item screening questions, participants who answered affirmatively had significantly higher likelihood of future shelter entry at each time point examined (eg, at 2 months: 31 participants responding yes [6.5%] vs 14 participants responding no [1.0%] to the question concerning being worried about having stable housing in the next 2 months). Sensitivity of the screening questions ranged from 0.27 to 0.69, specificity from 0.76 to 0.97, positive predictive value from 0.07 to 0.27, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve from 0.62 to 0.72. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE This study found that 2 single-item screening questions assessing ED patient self-perceived risk of future housing instability and homelessness had adequate to good performance in identifying risk for future shelter entry. Such single-item screening questions should be further tested before broad adoption.",

    "abstract": "In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Los Angeles County has, to date, executed agreements with 32 hotels/motels and is working with the Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority (LAHSA) to utilize these sites as emergency housing for high vulnerability homeless persons under Project Roomkey. This report is based on 1,498 persons housed through Project Roomkey as of April 30, 2020. A total of 297 of these persons provided with emergency housing are at least 65 years of age (19.8 percent).A Long-Term Housing Strategy Built on Two Objectives, Thee Commitments, and a Familiar Model:This report recommends a strategic approach to transitioning older adults from Project Roomkey to long-term housing arrangements that adopts a variant of the Rapid Re-Housing (RRH) model as a basic framework and places a premium on health and safety from exposure to COVID-19. The strategy would pursue basic two objectives: Objective 1: Ensure all Project Roomkey clients are placed into safe permanent or interim housing upon moving out of the participating hotels and motels. Objective 2: Housing placements of older adults out of Project Roomkey must include services that effectively address client vulnerabilities.To achieve these objectives, the County and LAHSA must commit to the following through a coordinatedand collaborative effort with cities and with a broad range of stakeholders that straddle governmentjurisdictions: Where continued occupancy in hotels participating in Project Roomkey is not possible, immediate placement of all clients in permanent housing or a on a rapid path to permanent housing arrangements that are safe and do not introduce added health risks. Provision of Housing Stabilization Case Management Services to all clients, encompassing mainstream benefits enrollment (e.g. SSI, SSDI, GR, CalFresh), housing transition counseling, landlord negotiation, coordination of move-in assistance, and transition to community health and service supports. A flexible approach in fitting clients to a diverse range of possible long-term subsidized housing options on a client-by-client basis, one informed by specific needs and vulnerabilities and oriented around safety from potential COVID-19 exposure through opportunities for self-isolation and quarantine.",

    "abstract": "This study explores the dynamic combination of structural factors, domestic conditions, individual and social characteristics, and personal choices that produced episodes of homelessness among a representative sample of young adults (aged 20 to 45) in the city of Philadelphia in the late 1980s. Forty-three single adult homeless people (31 men and 12 women) were selected from a variety of shelter and nonshelter locations and interviewed in-depth about their experiences of becoming homeless. Statistics describing the residential transitions of the survey participants and a weighted distribution of the casual factors of their homelessness revealed the major significance of family relations, work and income, drugs(abuse, dealing, and environment), disabilities and previous institutional experiences. On the basis of written transcripts, combinations of these contributing factors have been identified. Interview selections are provided to illustrate these combinations, or the dynamic \"pathways to homelessness\" and the active decision-making processes of the participants. The study findings are interpreted as showing that, considered independently, neither reductionist models of homelessness that emphasize the causal influence of deviant behavior (primarily mental illness and substance abuse), nor the deterministic models of homelessness that examine structural factors independent of their biographical mediation (such as the housing and income crises), are sufficient for understanding the complex relationships that produce episodes of homelessness. While historical, social and economic factors determine the extent and demographic distribution of residential instability in the population, the mediation of those factors in the domestic conditions, personal experiences and restricted choices of men and women is critical to understanding how people become homeless. This study includes a chapter examining the historical, social and economic contexts of residential instability among young adults in Philadelphia.",

    "abstract": "There is increasing evidence that youth aging out of the foster care system encounter substantial challenges in their transition to adulthood. Receipt of public assistance following discharge from care is one important indicator of the extent to which these youth experience economic difficulties, but prior research on the topic has a number of key limitations. Building on existing research, this study examines public assistance receipt following exit from care among a cohort of 7492 youth who were discharged from an out of home placement in Los Angeles County between 2002 and 2004 and who were aged 16 or above at their time of discharge. Results show that approximately28% of youth in the study sample received either CalWORKs, which is California's version of the Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF) program, or General Relief (GR), which is LA County's general assistance program for indigent adults, at some point over the study's follow-up period. Additionally, crossover youth, who have a history of involvement in both the child welfare and juvenile justice systems are more likely than their counterparts who were only involved in the child welfare system to receive both types of public assistance. Differences in the risk profiles for GR and CalWORKs receipt centered around gender, as males were far less likely to receive CalWORKs but more likely to receive GR. Findings from this study provide additional evidence that older youth who age out of or otherwise exit foster care struggle to achieve economic self-sufficiency andalso suggest that crossover youth constitute a distinct sub-group of youth exiting foster care who should betargeted for specialized forms of assistance.",

In this population-based cohort study, we assessed baseline risk factors for homelessness, including the role of service in the Iraq or Afghanistan conflicts, among a large cohort of recent veterans.Methods.

We used survival analysis methods to determine incidence rates and risk factors for homelessness, based on baseline data for military factors, demographic characteristics, and diagnoses of behavioral health disorders and traumatic brain injury.Results. Service in Iraq or Afghanistan and, more specifically, posttraumatic stress disorder among veterans deployed there, were significant risk factors of modest magnitude for homelessness, and socioeconomic and behavioral health factors provided stronger indicators of risk. Gender was not a significant indicator of differential risk.Conclusions. Although service in Iraq and Afghanistan was significant, socioeconomic and behavioral health indicators show more promise in efforts to use administrative data to inform prevention efforts by identifying veterans who are at elevated risk for becoming homeless upon their return to civilian life.",

Policy, research, and practice will be improved if greater attention is given to social context. The authors critically analyze the approach used in much of the psychiatric services literature to infer links between mental illness and social problems. They compare these studies with studies that have been more validly conceptualized to account for social context. With this broader perspective, the impact of mental illness on crime, unemployment, and homelessness appears to be much smaller than that implied by much of the psychiatric services literature. Poverty moderates the relationship between serious mental illness and social problems. Factors related to poverty include lack of education, problems with employment, substance abuse, and a low likelihood of prosocial attachments. This relationship is often complicated and is not amenable to simple explanations. Research and policy that take this complexity into account may lead to greater effectiveness in interventions for persons with serious mental illness.",

Methods: This study used shelter and street outreach records from a large U.S. city to identify 2,703 persons who met federal criteria for chronic homelessness during a three-year period. Identifiers for these persons were matched to administrative records for psychiatric care, substance abuse treatment, and incarceration. Results: Twenty percent of the persons who incurred the highest costs for services ccounted for 60% of the total service costs of approximately $20 million a year (or approximately $12 million). Most of the costs for this quintile were for psychiatric care and jail stays. Eighty-one percent of the persons in the highest quintile had a diagnosis of a serious mental illness, and 83% of the persons in the lowest quintile had a history of substance abuse treatment without a diagnosis of a serious mental illness. Conclusions: Supportive housing models for people with serious mental illness who experience chronic homelessness may be associated with substantial cost offsets, because the use of acute care services diminishes in an environment of housing stability and access to ongoing support services. However, because persons with substance use issues and no recent history of mental health treatment used relatively fewer and less costly services, cost neutrality for these persons may require less service-intensive programs and smaller subsidies.",

This study used logistic regression to analyze data from the Philadelphia Neighborhood Information System in order to determine which properties were most likely to become imminently dangerous. Several different characteristics of the property, including whether it was vacant, had outstanding housing code violations, and tax arrearages as well as characteristics of nearby properties were identified as significant predictors. Challenges common to the development of early warning systems - including integrating administrative data, defining abandonment, and modeling temporal and spatial data - are discussed along with policy implications for cities like Philadelphia that have thousands of vacant and abandoned properties.",

A Cox proportional-hazards model was developed to identify the effects of demographic, family structure, reason for homelessness, an time-related variables on the hazard rates for different types of shelter discharge and shelter reentry. The study specifically explores the significance of type of housing placement as a predictor variable for shelter reentry. Various demographic and family structure attributes are linked with shelter exit and reentry, including race and ethnicity, family size, age of family head, pregnancy status, and public assistance recipiency status. Although there is a trade-off between length of shelter stay and type of housing placement at shelter discharge, procuring subsidized housing is associated with a substantially lower probability of shelter readmission. Policy implications of these findings and future directions for research on the dynamics of family homelessness are discussed.",

    "abstract": "IntroductionUnderstanding the prevalence of and risk for homelessness among veterans is prerequisite to preventing and ending homelessness among this population. Homeless veterans are at higher risk for chronic disease; understanding the dynamics of homelessness among veterans can contribute to our understanding of their health needs.MethodsWe obtained data on demographic characteristics and veteran status for 130,554 homeless people from 7 jurisdictions that provide homelessness services, and for the population living in poverty and the general population from the American Community Survey for those same jurisdictions. We calculated prevalence of veterans in the homeless, poverty, and general populations, and risk ratios(RR) for veteran status in these populations. Risk for homelessness, as a function of demographic characteristics and veteran status, was estimated by using multivariate regression models.ResultsVeterans were overrepresented in the homeless population, compared with both the general and poverty populations, among both men (RR, 1.3 and 2.1, respectively) and women(RR, 2.1 and 3.0, respectively). Veteran status and black race significantly increased the risk for homelessness for both men and women. Men in the 45- to 54-year-old age group and women in the 18- to 29-year-old age group were at higher risk compared with other ages.ConclusionOur findings confirm previous research associating veteran status with higher risk for homelessness and imply that there will be specific health needs among the aging homeless population. This study is a basis for understanding variation in rates of, and risks for, homelessness in general population groups, and inclusion of health data from US Department of Veterans Affairs records can extend these results to identifying links between homelessness and health risks.",

    "abstract": "This study analyzes HMIS and American Community Survey data from seven jurisdictions to assess the prevalence and relative risk for homelessness among veterans by race, sex, age and poverty status. Results show that among the homeless population, approximately 14% of adult males and 2% of adult females are veterans. For males, this proportion is about 30% greater than the proportion of Veterans in the general population, and twice as large as the proportion of veterans in the population living below the poverty threshold. Similarly among the female homeless population, veterans are overrepresented compared to the general population by a factor of two, and by a factor of three when compared to the population living in poverty. The number of homeless veterans account for approximately 1% of male veterans and 2% of female veterans in the general population. These rates are higher for veterans identifying as black (4% for males, 5% for females). When looking only at veterans living below the poverty threshold, homeless veterans are 15% (regardless of sex) of this population, with this rate increasing to 30% when only looking at black veterans living in poverty. In multivariable analyses, veteran status was associated with increased risk of homelessness. For instance, after controlling for poverty, age, race, and geographic variation, female veterans are three times as likely as female non-Veterans to become homeless, and male Veterans are twice as likely as male non-veterans to become homeless. In terms of age, across the general homeless population (Veterans and non-Veterans), males have the highest risk for homelessness in the 4554 year age group. For females, risk for homelessness is highest among the 1829 year age group and risk declines as age increases. Black race (compared to all others) is consistently identified as a strong risk factor for homelessness, with little variation across sex.",

Administrative records from the NYC shelter system were matched with death records from the Social Security Administration for 160,525 persons. Crude mortality rates and life tables were calculated, and survival analyses were undertaken using these data. Life expectancy was 64.2 and 68.6 years for single adult males and single adult females, respectively, and among adults in families, life expectancy was 67.2 and 70.1 years for males and females, respectively. For both groups, exits to stable housing (subsidized or non-subsidized) were associated with reduced mortality hazard. And while mortality hazard was substantially reduced for the time adults were in shelters, extended shelter use patterns were associated with increased mortality hazard. Differences between single homelessness and family homelessness extend to disparities in mortality rates. Although causal links cannot be established here, results suggest that, for both subgroups of the homeless population, prompt resolution of homelessness and availability of housing interventions may contribute to reduced mortality.",

METHODS: Computerized service records on housing, shelter use, and health care services were linked to create an integrated data set for 3,167 persons who received NY/NY housing placements, which provided mental health services, and for a matched control group of persons with mental illness who used shelters but did not receive housing placements. Regression analyses were used to assess the relationships between shelter use and receipt of a placement. Differences in postplacement shelter use between NY/NY housing recipients and the matched control group were then examined at an individual level and a population level. RESULTS: Heavy users of the shelter system were more likely to be placed in NY/NY housing. In the two-year postplacement period, persons who received a NY/NY housing placement used, on average, 128.2 fewer shelter days than those in the control group. In 1996, the NY/NY housing initiative reduced the average nightly census in New York City shelters by an estimated 4.6 percent. CONCLUSIONS: Providing housing combined with mental health services is an effective approach to reducing shelter use among mentally ill persons who have a history of homelessness.",

These programs do not directly address the causes of homelessness, and residents are exposed to victimization and trauma during stays. We need an alternative that is more humane, as well as more efficient and effective at achieving outcomes. Purpose: This article uses research on homelessness to devise alternative forms of emergency assistance that could reduce the prevalence and/or duration of episodes of homelessness and much of the need for emergency shelter. Methods: We review analyses of shelter utilization patterns to identify subgroups of homeless single adults and families with minor children, and propose alternative program models aimed at the particular situations of each of these subgroups. Results and conclusions: We argue that it would be both more efficient and more humane to reallocate resources currently devoted to shelters. We propose the development of community-based programs that instead would focus on helping those with housing emergencies to remain housed or to quickly return to housing, and be served by mainstream social welfare programs. We advocate providing shelter on a limited basis and reserving transitional housing for individuals recently discharged from institutions. Chronic homelessness should be addressed by permanent supportive housing.",

The shelter system is found to be segregated by age, gender, family and disability status, with the young single men and families concentrated in the largest facilities (capacity more than 100). A majority of the city's shelters are run on a for-profit basis, many of which are small board and care facilities, although the plurality of shelter beds are in large, not-for profit shelters. Data are reported which reveal an annual rate of turnover in the shelter system of approximately 6 persons per bed, with an annual average length of stay of 60 days per client. However, repeat users are likely to account for as much as one-third of the shelter population at any given time. Considered together, these findings suggest that, for many people, the shelters serve primarily as a short-term supplement to a restricted range of housing opportunities in the community. The research and policy implications of this pattern of utilization are discussed.",

Because people who experience homelessness are often users of multiple systems, and are often homeless in part because of ineffective programs and insufficient aftercare, these data may be crucial to identifying the gaps that need to be filled to prevent and reduce the duration of homelessness spells. These data can also make visible what may otherwise be hidden and understudied aspects of the homelessness problem. The use of administrative data for purposes for which they were not originally intended also raises some ethical issues that must be considered in light of their potential to be misused.",

However, almost all prior studies examining the effectiveness of PSH have been conducted at the individual level, with only minimal attempts to empirically test the relationship between PSH and chronic homelessness at the community level. This study uses longitudinal data collected by the US Department of Housing and Urban Development HUD and several other sources to model the relationship between measures of community investment in PSH and rates of chronic homelessness. The results show modest negative associations between increased investment in PSH and rates of chronic homelessness over time. We discuss the implications of these findings for ongoing efforts to address chronic homelessness and future research.",

No pattern was evident as to which centers closed or merged by type of initial funding, although some states showed a concentration of mergers and closures. Data from the 1988 Inventory of Mental Health Organizations are used to characterize the centers still in operation by facility type, ownership, service mix and revenue mix.

Using integrated archival administrative data from the public school district and the municipal Office of Supportive Housing, multilevel linear models were estimated to test these associations while adjusting for nesting of students within schools. Findings demonstrated that homelessness had a unique association with problems in classroom engagement, school mobility was uniquely related to both academic achievement and problems in classroom engagement, and experiencing both homelessness and school mobility was the most detrimental for both forms of educational well-being. Absenteeism was found to partially mediate the relations between homelessness, school mobility, and problems in task engagement.

Ideology, politics and preservation of the status quo usually prevail. So, whats a well intentioned researcher to do? Persevere and become more tactical. After all, policy failures cant be ignored forever. Like good advocates, researchers too have to be opportunistic.

At the same time, awareness is growing that Hispanics are often underrepresented in housing and homelessness assistance programs relative to their poverty rate and compared with other groups with similar needs. This realization raises two immediate questions. First, to what extent are Hispanic households underrepresented in housing and homelessness programs across the country? Second, why is this the case? This article begins with a national analysis of Hispanic representation in federal housing subsidy programs and homeless shelter services at the county level. The authors test the relationship between a high degree of underrepresentation and county characteristics. The second part of the article presents a case study of Philadelphia using local program data, focus groups with residents, and direct interviews with 10 stakeholders to explore Hispanic Philadelphians housing experiences and barriers to participation in housing and homeless assistance programs. The data and methods employed in this article allow the authors to gain a better understanding of where and why low-income Hispanics do not access housing and homeless assistance and provide insight into how local and federal programs can be adjusted to better serve these growing needs.",

The results indicate that a substantial majority of homeless families stay in public shelters for relatively brief periods, exit, and do not return. Approximately 20 percent stay for long periods. A small but noteworthy proportion cycles in and out of shelters repeatedly. In general, families with long stays are no more likely than families with short stays to have intensive behavioral health treatment histories, to be disabled, or to be unemployed. Families with repeat stays have the highest rates of intensive behavioral health treatment, placement of children in foster care, disability, and unemployment. The results suggest that policy and program factors, rather than family characteristics, are responsible for long shelter stays. An alternative conceptual framework for providing emergency assistance to homeless families is discussed.",

The 2009 AHAR also marks continued improvement in both sources of estimates of homelessness used in the reports. A larger number of communities are reporting Homeless Management Information System (HMIS) data to the AHAR, which is used in the analysis of patterns of homelessness over a years time. In 2009, 334 communitiesrepresenting 2,988 counties and 1,056 citiesreported usable HMIS data to the report, a sizable increase from last years report (222 communities). At the same time, the point-in-time (PIT) counts essential for estimating the numbers and characteristics of all homeless people, both sheltered and unsheltered, are improving as communities use more rigorous methodologies for conducting the counts.

Also, for the first time, this years AHAR includes information about the use of permanent supportive housing (PSH) programs and the Homelessness Prevention and Rapid Re-Housing Program (HPRP). Altogether, the 2010 AHAR is the first report to provide national estimates on the use of the full continuum of homeless assistance programsfrom homelessness prevention to homeless residential services to permanent supportive housing.",

The report also provides demographic information about people who transitioned from homelessnesseither sheltered or unshelteredto permanent supportive housing (PSH) and rapid rehousing (RRH) during this same one-year period.Key Findings: In 2018, an estimated 1,446,000 people in the U.S. experienced sheltered homelessness at some point during the year. Nearly two-thirds were in households with only adults. Thirty-five percent of people who experienced homelessness were in families with children. A small share (only one percent) were in child-only households. Black or African American people were considerably overrepresented among people experiencing homelessness. While representing 13 percent of all U.S. heads of households and 22 percent of heads of households living in poverty, people identifying as black accounted for 43 percent of heads of shelteredhouseholds in 2018. Nearly one in five heads of households and other adults using shelters had a chronic pattern of homelessness (18%). One in every ten sheltered adults was a veteran.",

Preventing and ending homelessness requires accurate information on the size and nature of the homelessness in the country, both at a point-in-time and on an annual basis. This report provides information onthe one-year estimates of people who were able to access shelter programs in both 2019 and 2020. Following the implementation of a new platform for collecting data from communities, 2019 has now become the baseline year for tracking changes in the numbers and characteristics of people who use shelter programs at some timeduring a year.The COVID-19 pandemic hit the United States in March 2020, affecting six months of the 2020 reporting year. Data presented in this report reflect the considerable disruptions to the homeless service system during this time. Some shelters were closed, and many others reduced the number of beds available for occupancy.Data presented in this report show that the total number of people using shelters declined between 2019 and 2020. This decline likely reflects reduced shelter capacity in some communities, as well as peoples reluctance to enter shelters because of health and safety concerns.",

    "abstract": "The number of people officially enumerated as living on the streets in Japan has been consistently decreasing since 2003. As of January 2020, there were 3 992 unsheltered people counted on a single night, which is about16% of the peak in 2003. In contrast, in the US 226 080 people were counted as unsheltered on a single night in 2020 and this number has been consistently increasing since 2015. This paper will focus on one cause of this difference, the respective public assistance systems in the US and Japan. The main public assistance system in Japan, Seikatsu-Hogo (Livelihood Protection) is argued to be a major factor driving the decline in the number of people living unsheltered there. But the characteristics of the Livelihood Protection programme that have contributed to this decline in street homelessness have not been examined in detail. We argue that three characteristics of Japans public assistance programme are at the core of its success in addressing street homelessness 1) generality, 2) comprehensiveness, and 3) expeditiousness. We also provide an overview of some important shortcomings of the programme. Clarifying how Japan has been able to reduce street homelessness provides insights for measures to address street homelessness in the US and other countries.",

The evaluation used the Rapid Assessment, Response, and Evaluation method to collect qualitative findings on service use barriers and facilitators from open-ended interviews with people staying in the encampments (N = 27) and service providers (N = 1 0). We assessed how the ERP allowed providers to \"push the system\" by removing access barriers, and providing amenable, effective, and accessible housing and drug treatment services that led to more widely adopted best practices. However, there was a clear need for additional supportive services and aftercare for those exiting treatment. Providers also cited a need for more integrated medical and mental health services.",

Data for this study came from administrative records on shelter use in New York City and from the nationwide shelter and general population enumerations in each of the last two decennial census enumerations. Results are presented in a series of figures to illustrate 1) the changes in the age distributions of the homeless population over time; and 2) the age distribution of homeless populations compared to other populations. In the late 1980s, homeless single adults and adults in families were relatively young, with the median age for both being in the late-twenties. Subsequently, however, these household types appear to have diverged, as the birth cohort from which the young single adults had come (born 1954-1965) has continued to be overrepresented in the shelter population, whereas homelessness among adults in families has remained linked to households in the early parenting years (ages 18-23). While the families and the single adults may have experienced some common precipitating factors that led to the emergence of homelessness in the 1980s, the young mothers appear to age out of their risk for homelessness while homelessness among this birth cohort of single adults sustains. Hypotheses are discussed regarding the social and economic factors that may be associated with disproportionate housing instability and homelessness among adults from the latter half of the baby boom cohort. Implications for public policy are considered, including the premature risk of disability, frailty and mortality associated with this cohort.",

    "abstract": "STUDY OBJECTIVE: Administrative databases from the City of Philadelphia that track public shelter utilisation (n=44 337) and AIDS case reporting (n=7749) were merged to identify rates and risk factors for co-occurring homelessness and AIDS. DESIGN: Multiple decrement life tables analyses were conducted, and logistic regression analyses used to identify risk factors associated with AIDS among the homeless, and homelessness among people with AIDS. SETTING: City of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA. MAIN RESULTS: People admitted to public shelters had a three year rate of subsequent AIDS diagnosis of 1.8 per 100 person years; nine times the rate for the general population of Philadelphia. Logistic regression results show that substance abuse history (OR = 3.14), male gender (OR = 2.05), and a history of serious mental disorder (OR = 1.62) were significantly related to the risk for AIDS diagnosis among shelter users. Among people with AIDS, results show a three year rate of subsequent shelter admission of 6.9 per 100 person years, and a three year rate of prior shelter admission of 9%, three times the three year rate of shelter admission for the general population. Logistic regression results show that intravenous drug user history (OR = 3.14); no private insurance (OR = 2.93); black race (OR = 2.82); pulmonary or extra-pulmonary TB (OR = 1.43); and pneumocystis pneumonia (OR = 0.56) were all related to the risk for shelter admission. CONCLUSIONS: Homelessness prevention programmes should target people with HIV risk factors, and HIV prevention programmes should be targeted to homeless persons, as these populations have significant intersection. Reasons and implications for this intersection are discussed.",

    "abstract": "This paper discusses how researchers and others have analyzed the services histories of persons who have experienced homelessness, as well as their imputed costs. This research has been used both to make visible the ways in which the clients of mainstream social welfare systems (health, corrections, income maintenance and child welfare) become homeless and, complementarily, the impact of people who experience homelessness on the use of these service systems. Most published work in this area has been based on the integration of administrative databases to identify cases and service utilization patterns; some have used retrospective interviews. Results have been used to encourage agency administrators and policymakers to make investments in programs that reduce homelessness and/or the duration of homelessness periods. Quite recently, many local homeless services planning organizations in the US have used this approach to demonstrate the high costs of chronic homelessness and the potential cost offsets associated with the placement of people in supported housing. The opportunities and limitations associated with these various approaches, including their potential applicability to other countries and service sectors are discussed.",

A surplus bed capacity among for-profit psychiatric hospitals is presumed to contribute to lower occupancy rates and less turnover in the for-profit sector. Not-for-profit psychiatric facilities are also found to be more involved in professional training and to be more accessible through emergency services. However, the misclassification test in the discriminant procedure reveals that a significant group of not-for-profit facilities looks more like its for-profit counterpart group than like other not-for-profits.

Compared with known users, nonusers and occasional users were less likely to have had a severe mental illness diagnosis or to have received either disability benefits or Medicaid coverage and were more likely to be white. Nonusers and occasional users were also more likely than known users to have died in outlying parts of the city.Conclusions: More conventional homeless surveys and enumerations miss a substantial portion of the homelesspopulation.

    "abstract": "Amidst concern about the implications of an aging U.S. population, recent evidence suggests that there is a unique aging trend among the homeless population. Building on this, we use data from New York City and from the last three decennial Census enumerations to assess how the age composition of the homeless populationboth single adults and adults in familieshas changed over time. Findings show diverging trends in aging patterns for single adults and adults in families over the past 20 years. Among single adults, the bulk of the sheltered population is comprised of persons born during the latter part of the baby boom era whose high risk for homelessness has continued as they have aged. Specifically, the age group in this population facing the highest risk for homelessness was 3436 (born 19541956) in 1990; 3742 (born 19581963) in 2000; and 4951 (born 19591961) in 2010. In contrast, among adults in sheltered families, there is no indication of any progressive aging of the family household heads. The modal age across the study period remains at 2123 years of age. We consider implications for the health care and social welfare systems, and policy responses to homelessness.",

    "abstract": "In April 2020, the National Alliance to End Homelessness (NAEH) conducted a national survey of local homeless assistance coordinating agencies, or Continuums of Care, to understand the impacts of COVID-19 and how communities have responded to this unprecedented public health crisis. On January 30, 2020 the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the novel coronavirus outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International concern and on February 11, 2020 the WHO announced the name of the new coronavirus disease: COVID-19 (WHO, 2020). By mid-March, starting with California, in almost every state in the United States, persons were encouraged to shelter in place and to practice social distancing to flatten the growth curve of infection to allow hospitals and emergency health care resources to adequately keep pace with those experiencing acute medical crises (Baral et al., 2020). Asking citizens to shelter in place and practice social distancing created an unprecedented urgency for communities across the country to respond to the needs of persons experiencing homelessness in the face of this crisis (Doran et al., 2020; Lima et al., 2020; Tsai & Wilson, 2020).Primary concerns that quickly emerged across the nation were: How to provide shelter for people experiencing homelessness who become infected with COVID-19 How to provide adequate shelter to prevent COVID-19 infection among medically vulnerable persons experiencing homelessness (over 65, underlying health conditions) How to address shelter density in existing congregate shelters to comply with CDC guidance for social distancing in shelters (110 sq ft per person) How to address the health and safety of unsheltered persons including people in encampments, in light of the crisis; How to protect staff who serve persons experiencing homelessness How to acquire financial resources and PPE supplies to address the needs of people who are homeless How to coordinate screening, testing, tracking and contact tracing with community partners. The responses to this survey provide an understanding of how communities through their CoCs have responded to COVID-19 in the first 4-6 weeks of the crisis.",

    "abstract": "The nation is now ten months into a national emergency caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. For homeless services systems, it has impacted temporary housing offerings, staffing, resources, and countless other areas. To understand these changes, the Alliance initiated the Voices from the Field project, which has included three national surveys, a series of interviews, and data collection from a small sampling of Continuums of Care (CoCs). The current report highlights the most recent survey (conducted in November) and some insights from the data collection efforts.The findings point to systems that quickly set up motel/hotel programs, most of which are still up and running as of November. Although survey respondents report expanding the availability of permanent housing, they also estimate that most clients leaving these quarantine/isolation rooms return to shelters and unsheltered locations. Frustration with this norm is causing CoC representatives to identify permanent housing as their number one priority for any new resources that become available. Other significant needs include staffing and growing existing motel/hotel efforts. If CoCs are unable to fund such items, they predict tragic consequences such as growth in unsheltered homelessness.",

    "abstract": "The impacts of COVID-19 on American life have been widespread. Not only is the virus a public health crisis but it is complicating efforts to recover from the current recession. In difficult times such as these, the most vulnerable people tend to endure the most significant hardships while being left behind on the road to recovery. Local homeless services providers play a crucial role in reducing the harm. Thus, the Alliance is tracking their progress in responding to the current moment.Alliance staff and research partners conducted an online survey of Continuum of Care (CoC) leaders in April, publishing the results in Community-level Responses of Homelessness Assistance Programs to COVID-19: Data from May 2020 and a supplementary policy brief. Alliance staff and researchers further explored the issues raised within a series of interviews. Responding to COVID-19: Conversations with Homeless System Leaders summarizes our discussions with a subset of survey respondents. Altogether, the findings suggested systems were overwhelmed by new responsibilities, a lack of available supplies, staffing shortages, and severe financial limitations.The current report reflects the findings of a second online survey of CoC leaders, and notes note progress in areas such as access to personal protective equipment (PPE), screening, and testing. However, there continue to be challenges as systems simultaneously juggle the pressures to 1) respond to public health needs, 2) maintain system functioning, and 3) continue to make progress on the goal of reducing homelessness.",

Results show that inpatient and foster care services use drops in the homelessness period, but rebounds following exit, regardless of pattern of shelter use, and type of housing exit. Results suggest that shelters supplant use of services, but not on a sustained basis. Despite declines in concurrent services use, the homelessness period is overall more costly for episodically and long-term shelter users, primarily owing to the high costs of shelter. High rates of inpatient and foster care services use following the homeless spell suggest that providers of homeless assistance should systematically screen and refer homeless families to on-going community-based service supports. Service use patterns indicate that homeless spells may disrupt continuity of care with community-based health and social services.",

We examine these disparities using administrative data from public health agencies, utility companies, and primary data collected from hundreds of Pennsylvanians through surveys and focus groups.We find that a breadth of vulnerabilities faced by all Pennsylvania residents are particularly acute for racial and ethnic minorities. Low-income, Black, and Latinx residents are more likely to be rent-burdened and pay more money toward their utility bills than their counterparts. They are also more likely to experience utility insecurity. Areas with higher concentrations of minority residents have much higher rates of utility arrears and disconnections as well as much higher rates of enrollment in utility assistance programs. In addition, roughly three-quarters of Black and Latinx survey respondents reported falling behind on rent or mortgage paymentssince March, and one-third of Black residents reported being either formally or informally evicted and were the most likely to worry about future evictions and utility shutoffs. We also found that communities with higher non-white shares of the population were hit hardest by the coronavirus, especially in the early months. The relationship between virus prevalence and race became less pronounced as the virus became more ubiquitous through the fall and winter.",

Most reforms have focused on reducing the capacity of the shelter system by reducing the average length of stay of persons in shelter and by providing housing relocation assistance. However, these reforms have been compromised by an inability to contol the demand for shelter, particularly the rate of new admissions , and by the extent of need for housing assistance among homeless and near-homeless people in Philadelphia. Alternative methods of financing shelters are described, as are attempts to create a system of specialty shelter providers.

The adult outcomes of youth in each of these three groups are analyzed by linking their administrative records from Los Angeles Countys Department of Children and Family Services (DCFS) and/or Probation Department with administrative databases from seven County departments providing an array of public services to residents of Los Angeles County, as well as from two California statewide agencies. Results indicate high levels of correctional system and public assistance involvement across the study groups, with particularly high rates of utilization among crossover youth. Patterns of health and behavioral health services use follow a similar pattern. Imputed costs by group and by service sector are reported. Educational attainment and reported income are also documented. Regression analyses examine independent predictors of various outcomes by study group.",

Second, we seek to better understand possible dynamics that might contribute to such a paradox through conducting focus groups with service providers, clients and city agency and nonprofit staff.

    "abstract": "The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) is pleased to present this second national report to Congress on homelessness in America. The first Annual Homeless Assessment Report (AHAR) was submitted in February 2007. These reports were developed in response to a series of Congressional directives beginning with the FY 2001 HUD Appropriations Act. In that year, Congress directed the Department to assist communities to implement local Homeless Management Information Systems (HMIS) and required every jurisdiction to have client-level reporting within three years. Senate Report 106-410 noted that HMIS data could be used to develop an unduplicated count of homeless people and to analyze the use and effectiveness of homeless assistance services. To that end, Congress further charged the Department with collecting and analyzing HMIS data from a representative sample of communities in order to understand the nature and extent of homelessness nationally. The second AHAR makes use of two primary data sources. The first source is HMIS data on the number, characteristics, and patterns of shelter use among sheltered homeless persons - or persons who used emergency and transitional housingduring a six-month period from January 1 through June 30, 2006. The data were obtained from a nationally representative sample of communities. A total of 58 sample sites participated in the second AHAR, including 49 communities that participated in the first AHAR and 9 new sample communities that were not able to provide data for the first report. Because some sample communities are still working to secure the participation of homeless assistance providers in HMIS, not all could provide data for this analysis (or could provide only partial data). As a result, the estimates provided in this report have large confidence intervals (i.e., sampling error).",

Estimated public spending on the 86 people for 90 days was 742,141 in total and 8,630 on average. If the 86 people had been homeless for one year with the same pattern of service use, estimated public spending would be 34,518 on average per person per year, a total of some 2.96 million annually. For a single homeless population of 40,000, if estimated costs were at the average level, annual public expenditure would be some 1.38 billion.This report also uses the available data to estimate the changes in service use that would occur, if someone were not homeless - because their homelessness was prevented - compared to the costs that arose because they were homeless. On average, it was estimated that preventing homelessness for one year would result in a reduction in public expenditure of 9,266 per person. The potential saving could be estimated as being as high as 796 thousand.",

    "abstract": "This paper reports results from a study of the treated prevalence of mental health and substance use disorders among adults admitted to Philadelphia public shelters between 1990 and 1992 (N=28,638). Identifiers and service records from longitudinal databases on shelter and mental health services were merged, finding that 49% of single homeless adults and 33.2% of homeless adults with children had a treatment for a mental health or substance use disorder between 1985 and 1993. The rate of treatment for serious mental illness (SMI) was 10.7% (by most frequently occurring diagnosis). Single women (18.6%) had twice the rate of SMI as single men (9.9%), and single adults (12.1%) had twice the rate of SMI as adults with children (6.2%). The treate rate of substance use disorders (25.2%) was higher than the rate of mental health disorders (20%), and was twice as high for single adults (28.6%) as for adults with children (14.6%). An additional 20% of adult shelter users were identified through shelter records as having untreated substance use problems. Veterans had comparable rates of disorders as nonveterans. Oveall, 65% of adult shelter users were identified as ever having some mental health or substance use problem, treated or untreated. People with SMI were less represented among shelter users on two single day censuses than over three years, suggesting a higher rate of turnover among people with SMI, while people with substance use disorders were overrepresented by a third on the two single day censuses, suggesting a lower rate of turnover among people treated for sugbstance abuse. Of the treated Medicaid population, 6.8% became homeless in the three year study period, representing 7.8% of the treated population with SMI, 9.5% of the treated schizophrenia population, and 20.1% of the population receiving inpatient substance abuse services. Approximately 3,000 people with SMI became homeless in the 3-year study period, with an average of 73 people with SMI entering shelter for the first time each month. An analysis of inpatient usage found that 25.7% of the SMI and 34.2% of the treated substance abuse population were hospitalized within 120 days of their first shelter admission (before or after). Fourteen percent of the SMI were also seen in an emergency room within 120 days of shelter admission (before or after).",

    "abstract": "A group of international researchers with experience of strategic analysis of homelessness policy, practice and service programmes were asked to review the effects of the Rebuilding Ireland strategy on the level and nature of Irish homelessness. The review took the stance of a critical friend, drawing on possible lessons from practice elsewhere in Europe and in North America.The review included discussions and consultations with stakeholders in the design and delivery of homelessness policy and services and with people with lived experience of homelessness, who were asked about the issues they thought were most important in reducing homelessness in Ireland. Irish views on strengths and limitations were identified through these discussions, which were then used to structure the wider analysis in this review, drawing on possibly beneficial practice from other countries and avoiding some of the problems other countries had encountered. The review did not consider the specific questions arising around migrant groups who are ineligible to join housing lists.Homelessness was seen as being defined in a relatively narrow way, i.e. focusing on people sleeping rough and the number and duration of stays in emergency accommodation. This was seen as neglecting hidden homelessness and by extension, not fully recognising and not fully responding to the true nature of homelessness in Ireland. While some measures had fallen, experience of homelessness remained more common than had been the case. Existing measures were also thought to highlight urban homelessness.Womens experience of homelessness tends to be significantly underestimated when enumeration does not include an attempt to count hidden homelessness. The most effective, integrated strategies, including practice in Scotland and Finland, use a wide definition of homelessness which facilitates a more comprehensive array of prevention, rapid rehousing and housing-led, Housing First and supported housing services and cross referral of a broadly defined at risk population across wider health, criminal justice and social protection systems.Affordable and social housing supply were thought to be at the core of homelessness causation and the limitations of existing policy in preventing and ending homelessness. Services like Housing First were hampered, as was any service within a housing-led framework as soon as adequate, affordable housing with reasonable security of tenure was in short supply. Progress was noted in addressing these issues, but more social and affordable housing was needed. People with lived experience of homelessness reported that only social housing offered the affordability, standards and security of tenure that enabled a sustained exit from homelessness.Internationally, no level of coordination, evidence-led practice or comprehensiveness of response has been found that counteracts the effects of insufficient affordable, adequate homes with security of tenure. Prevention, housing-led and Housing First services, alongside the integration of health, mental health, addiction, criminal justice and welfare systems in a homelessness strategy will either be limited, or fail, if there are not enough suitable homes with which to prevent and end homelessness.Progress has been made in homelessness prevention in Ireland, although with the caveat that the ongoing issues with inadequate housing supply limit overall effectiveness. There are lessons from comprehensive preventative systems used in other countries, such as that developed in Wales, which define and respond to homelessness on a broad basis and appear to reach much of the population who are at risk of homelessness.Housing First has become a significant part of the policy response to homelessness. Systems are at their most developed in Dublin and other urban areas, with reports of more uneven coverage in some more rural areas. Internationally, the key lesson appears to be that Housing First delivered through a coherent, comprehensive and well-resourced strategy achieves both better coverage and more consistent results. Something to avoid is the rather haphazard development of many small scale projects, which while they may show success, are not part of a coherent, properly resourced national plan, leading to inconsistencies in coverage and results, as seen in England, Italy and Sweden.The needs of women, which are distinct, in the sense that their homelessness is much more closely associated with domestic abuse (much family homelessness is women lone parents and dependent children at risk of domestic abuse) and they are more likely to avoid (often male dominated) services and use informal arrangements with family, friends or acquaintances (hidden homelessness). With some exceptions in terms of women-only, housing-led and Housing First services, much service provision is still built on an assumption that homelessness is mainly experienced by lone men. This is not specific to Ireland, greater recognition of womens needs and experiences and the extent of their homelessness is a pan-EU issue.North West European and North American countries tend to recognise young people, including care leavers (young adults who have been in care of social work/child protection services) as having specific needs when they experience homelessness, centring on their youth, adverse childhood experiences and associated vulnerability. This is an area that could be the subject of more detailed policy consideration in Ireland.Coordination of services and information about those services were reported as inconsistent and as in need of improvement by people with lived experience of homelessness. The standardisation of responses seen in strategies like that of Finland or the (distinct) legislative frameworks of Scotland and Wales may be useful in addressing this issue.The review has drawn together key lessons from international experience that may be of use as the new strategy Housing for All is implemented, these include:Recognising that a broader definition of homelessness can be the gateway to building a more comprehensive, effective strategic response.Prevention, housing-led and Housing First services are most effective when part of an integrated, interagency homelessness strategy because they depend on cross referral to an array of other services.Implementation must be comprehensive if a strategy is to work and this means that governance must be clear, focused and stable, ensuring that coherent strategy steadily builds in effectiveness over time.",

    "abstract": "Findings from Year 4 show that, for the third consecutive year, over 20,000 people experiencing homelessness exited homeless services to Permanent Housing (PH) placements (macro-measure 2). Nearly 10,000 of these PH placements occurred within the purview of HI-supported initiatives (meso-measure 3). Looking at these PH placements over the last three years, 56,000 unduplicated people exited shelter stays to PH (both HI- and non-HI-funded), and 31,000 of these exits came under the auspices of HI-supported services.Noteworthy also were Interim Housing (IH) placements, which declined 25% after significant year-over-year growth since FY 2016-17. Building IH capacity is a key component of reducing LAs large unsheltered population, and the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the resulting need to decompress shelter facilities, has handed these efforts an additional challenge. The reduction in IH housing capacity in Year 4 is one of the first indicators of COVID-19s impact on LAs homeless services, and COVID-19 will almost certainly have a much larger impact on HI strategies in the upcoming Year 5. In addition, the rental unit vacancies in LA has been very low over the past couple of years making permanent housing opportunities harder to secure. This has made the IH lengths of stay longer, thus reducing the number of IH beds that turn over.",

The analysis then moves down to the program or meso-level in Section 3, separately exploring HI strategy outcomes aggregated into broader categories, the three most important of which are permanent housing (PH), interim housing (IH), and prevention. This separate analysis of the HI strategies as a collective program enables their performance to be gauged against comparable non-HI service categories while also establishing a basis for measuring the HIs contribution to systemwide performance. Appendix A provides the performance measurements at the level of individual strategies. In addition, Section 4 provides an assessment of the Los Angeles Homeless Services Authoritys (LAHSAs) recent Point-in-Time (PIT) homeless counts informed by a homeless services systems through-flow analysis, and Section 5 provides a pre/post evaluation of health, mental health and jail outcomes for households placed by HI.",

The rate of shelter admission is strongly and positively related to the concentration of poor, African-American, and female-headed households with young children in a neighborhood. It is also correlated with fewer youth, elderly, and immigrants.

    "abstract": "Equity assessments, like those described in this working paper, have historical roots in the Civil Rights movement. As part of demands for equitable access to jobs, resources, and services, communities of color and Civil Rights advocates pressed public and private institutions to document the representation of racial and ethnic groups (National Archives, 2016). Corrective action plans were used to develop clear strategies to redress inequities and hold institutions accountable to change. Affirmative action policies reinforced these strategies by requiring certain groups, such as federal contractors, to develop numerical targets and timelines to correct for underutilization of services by marginalized groups (Legal Information Institute, n.d.).Human service agencies are now being called upon once again to address inequities within their programs. In January 2021, President Biden signed the Executive Order on Advancing Racial Equity and Support for Underserved Communities Through the Federal Government, which requires federal agencies to identify methods for assessing equity within federal programs and to engage communities historically underserved or discriminated against in these programs (Exec. Order No. 13985, 2021). This working paper strives to build upon the aims of the Civil Rights movement to help human service agencies estimate and respond to racial and ethnic inequities in their service provision. The urgency of this work is underscored not only by the executive order, but also by the long overdue social unrest around racialized violence and inequity in the U.S. and the stark racial disparities in experience and outcomes of the COVID-19 pandemic.The following sections of this paper outline three phases of workperforming a gaps analysis (measuring gaps between need for and current availability of services), interpreting the gaps analysis (assessing root causes of the problem and strategizing responses), and co-creating an equity plan (determining next steps and implementing strategies to correct for inequities). Importantly, community organizations and those with lived experiences of the systems under consideration need to be engaged throughout this entire process. See AToolkit for Centering Racial Equity Throughout Data Integration for more (Hawn Nelson et al., 2020a). In addition, the general process provided here will need to be customized based on the social issue of interest, local context, available data, and resource constraints. Drawing upon multiple data sources, types of expertise, and stakeholder perspectives is highly recommended in order to robustly assess and respond to inequities in service provision. Altogether, these methods can inform social policymaking and support human serviceagencies in more equitable resource allocation and service provision.",

    "abstract": "The economic and social impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic have heightened demand for cross-agency data capacity, as policymakers are forced to reconcile the need for expanded services with extreme fiscal constraints. In this context, integrated data systems (IDS) also commonly referred to as data hubs, data collaboratives, or state longitudinal data systems are a valuable resource for data-informed decision making across agencies. IDS utilize standard governance processes and legal agreements to grant authority for routine, responsible use of linked data, and institutionalize roles across partners with shared priorities. Despite these benefits, creating and sustaining IDS remains a challenge for many states. Legislation and executive action can be powerful mechanisms to overcome this challenge and promote the use of cross-agency data for public good.This brief is organized in three parts. First, we offer examples of approaches from states that have used legislation and/or executive orders to enable data integration, as well as key considerations related to each. Second, we discuss state and federal funding opportunities that can help in implementing legislative or executive actions on data sharing and enhancing long-term sustainability of data sharing efforts. Third, we offer five foundational strategies to ensure that legislative or executive action is both ethical and effective.",

    "abstract": "This evaluation is an independent examination of the City of Philadelphias Encampment Resolution Pilot (ERP), an initiative to shut down two homeless encampments located in the Kensington section of Philadelphia. The closure process involved an extended period of active outreach that facilitated access to housing, substance use treatment, and other services to people who stayed in the encampments and faced displacement. We examined two primary outcomes: first, whether the encampments were closed as scheduled and remained closed; and, second, the extent to which the people who were sleeping in the encampments (i.e., the target population) received needed services.The evaluation is based upon five primary data collection activities that, combined, provided a timely, multifaceted assessment of ERP, and particularly of the impacts ERP had on both those displaced by the initiative and the area of Kensington surrounding these encampments. These data components are:1. An Outreach Encampment and Survey of 169 persons who frequented the encampments;2. Data collected as part of ERP outreach services and linked to the City of Philadelphias integrated data system of services records known as CARES;3. Direct observation of community meetings, ERP planning meetings, and encampment sites;4. Interviews with people who stayed in encampments and community members as well as advocates for those staying in the encampments, and ERP officials and providers; and5. Documents and records from City of Philadelphia and other sources, and media coverage related to ERP and Kensington",

Medicaid records for 59,135 heads of families receiving Temporary Assistance to Needy Families benefits were matched with data from Philadelphias municipal shelter system. Propensity score matching was used to select a matched control group to those identified as having been homeless between 1997 and 2003. Behavioral health services utilization was then assessed based on Medicaid claims records. Results. Substantially higher levels of behavioral health services use and corresponding costs were found among heads of families with a history of shelter use. Conclusions. Greater use of behavioral health services by heads of homeless families may reflect greater severity of disorders or a greater likelihood to seek treatment relative to what has been suggested by previous research.",
