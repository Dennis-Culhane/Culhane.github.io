    "abstract": "The transition to adulthood is a particularly difficult time for most youth, and this difficulty is magnified for young adults experiencing homelessness. These young people have often already survived adverse childhood experiences such as foster care, family conflict, and housing instability. Existing support systems designed for youth were strained by the COVID-19 pandemic, which resulted in heightened social isolation, trauma, financial stress, and reduced school engagement for these young people. Preventing homelessness among youth requires multifaceted approaches and presents new opportunities for cross-agency interventions.This research study by the New York City Center for Innovation through Data Intelligence (CIDI), conducted in collaboration with partners at the University of Pennsylvania, examines the characteristics and experiences of New York City Public Schools (NYCPS) students who experienced homelessness as young adults between the ages of 18-21. The study compares the experiences of these students to those of all students in NYCPS. Its goal is to enable the creation of new supports that facilitate pathways to success.",

    "abstract": "Drawing on experience from the United States, this chapter explores the challenges at improving global statistics on the extent and nature of homelessness. Definitions and measurements of homelessness have political and ideological dimensions as well as having methodological implications for how homelessness is enumerated. This chapter explores the ways in which the United States moved from definitions and counts focused on street homelessness to much wider and more comprehensive definitions and new ways of finding and accurately counting people experiencing homelessness. This has included the use of increasingly refined PIT (point-in-time) methods. The importance of common administrative systems and data sharing in understanding the nature and extent of homelessness and the characteristics of people experiencing homelessness is also examined. The progress in measurement is considered in relation to some ongoing challenges in measurement. Difficulties still exist in reliably finding populations who can be hidden from standard survey methods, have infrequent contact with administrative systems, and can sometimes be highly mobile.",

    "abstract": "This chapter looks at the nature, extent, and experience of homelessness in the United States. An overview of federal responses to homelessness is provided, alongside a discussion of the definition and enumeration of homelessness. The scale and nature of homelessness, experienced by 580,000 people on a single night just before the COVID-19 pandemic engulfed the United States in 2020, are explored and the different dimensions, including veteran homelessness, are examined. This chapter also looks at how patterns of homelessness and levels of homelessness have changed over time, including the successes that were achieved in reducing overall homelessness from 2009 to 2019. The state of academic debate on causation and reduction of homelessness is summarized, including Housing First and the use of rapid re-housing. While progress occurs in other areas, this chapter concludes that the prevention of homelessness in the United States remained an aspirational strategy in the early 2020s.",

    "abstract": "In July 2023, the Office of the Homeless Initiative (HI) within Los Angeles County's Chief Executive Office commenced its eighth year and the seventh since the County began receiving Measure H sales tax proceeds to fund services at the basis of a coordinated approach to ending the homelessness crisis. This evaluation examines Year 6, which occurred in the County's 2021-22 Fiscal Year (FY), as well as the first six years of the HI overall.Year 5 was the final year before the implementation of a new guiding framework implemented in response to a reassessment of the HI's originating strategies for addressing the Countywide homelessness crisis. In Year 6, the HI therefore underwent a significant transition after the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors approved the new approach, which aimed to streamline and consolidate 51 HI strategies into five primary activities: Coordination, Prevention, Connection, Housing, and Stabilization. The renewed framework additionally introduced a new supporting activities category to encompass previous strategies focused on capacity building and coordination across public services domains. The HI's new approach places renewed emphasis on collaboration with key partners integral to ending the homelessness crisis, including the Homeless Rehousing System, the County's Mainstream Government Systems, and local cities.",

    "abstract": "Objectives: The purposes of this study are to examine (i) to what extent job loss and food insecurity accounted for racial disparities in generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) risk among adults in the United States during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic; and (ii) to what extent the COVID-19 vaccination mitigated such risk, especially among older adults.Methods: First, we analyzed data from the U.S. Household Pulse Survey to report on the relative prevalence of GAD with respect to demographic characteristics, economic hardships, and COVID-19 vaccine status. We then adopted a series of logistic regression models to estimate the probabilities of having GAD by sequentially adding these possible explanatory factors.Results: Findings demonstrated higher prevalence rates of GAD among Hispanic and non-Hispanic Black Americans than non-Hispanic White Americans, which can primarily be attributed to the fact that non-Hispanic White Americans were less vulnerable to job loss and food insecurity. Older adults were less susceptible to GAD than their middle-aged and young adult counterparts. Compared to unvaccinated older adults, the odds of having GAD were substantially reduced for older adults who were partially vaccinated, and even more significantly declined for fully vaccinated older adults.Discussion: Racial and ethnic disparities in GAD were largely due to disproportionate experiences of job loss and food insecurity across different racial and ethnic groups during the pandemic. Social distancing measures partially explain the different prevalence of GAD between older adults and their counterparts. Rapid deployment of the COVID-19 vaccines played an effective role in suppressing GAD, especially among older adults.",

The use of integrated data systems (IDS), which can be used to link administrative records from multiple public agencies into one database, offer a unique mechanism for providing the type of comprehensive information that is important for understanding the complex needs of vulnerable populations and for making data-based policy and program decisions that translate into more effective and efficient policies. In this paper, we draw on recent efforts to restructure Los Angeles Countys General Relief (GR) Program a cash assistance program for indigent adults as an example of how the effective use of IDS can play a crucial role in generating evidence that can guide important program and policy decisions.",

    "abstract": "This study tests a typology of family homelessness based on patterns of public shelter utilization and examines whether family characteristics are associated with those patterns. The results indicate that a substantial majority of homeless families stay in public shelters for relatively brief periods, exit, and do not return. Approximately 20 percent stay for long periods. A small but noteworthy proportion cycles in and out of shelters repeatedly. In general, families with long stays are no more likely than families with short stays to have intensive behavioral health treatment histories, to be disabled, or to be unemployed. Families with repeat stays have the highest rates of intensive behavioral health treatment, placement of children in foster care, disability, and unemployment. The results suggest that policy and program factors, rather than family characteristics, are responsible for long shelter stays. An alternative conceptual framework for providing emergency assistance to homeless families is discussed.",

    "abstract": "This study examines families use of behavioral health hospitalization and foster care placement prior to, during and following shelter use, comparing families based on shelter pattern and type of housing exit. Results show that inpatient and foster care services use drops in the homelessness period, but rebounds following exit, regardless of pattern of shelter use, and type of housing exit. Results suggest that shelters supplant use of services, but not on a sustained basis. Despite declines in concurrent services use, the homelessness period is overall more costly for episodically and long-term shelter users, primarily owing to the high costs of shelter. High rates of inpatient and foster care services use following the homeless spell suggest that providers of homeless assistance should systematically screen and refer homeless families to on-going community-based service supports. Service use patterns indicate that homeless spells may disrupt continuity of care with community-based health and social services.",

    "abstract": "This longitudinal study explores heterogeneity of middle school students by identifying subgroups of youth characterized by distinct truancy trajectories and by determining disability profiles that distinguish these subgroups. Participants comprised an entire 7th through 9th grade student population, with approximately 58,000 students, in a large urban school district. Latent class growth analysis was used to identify subgroups of truant youth. This analysis yielded five distinct truant subgroups: Very- Low (37 %), Low (43.4 %), Declining (3.3 %), Rising (12.8 %), and Chronic (3.6 %). Further, differential disability profiles were found in each subgroup with the control of demographic characteristics (i.e., gender, race/ethnicity, free/reduced lunch, Limited English Proficiency, grade, and prior school absences), students with serious emotional disturbance and learning disabilities demonstrated amplified risks of being classified in the Chronic or Rising subgroups, which show chronic or incremental upward truant trajectories over time. These findings are discussed in terms of their implications for future research.",

    "abstract": "Housing First is a proven evidence-based approach to addressing homelessness. However, programs operating under the Housing First model do not receive the necessary funding to meet the needs of all people experiencing homelessness.The estimated gaps and costs are hypothetical for a few important reasons: they do not include the needs of exclusively unsheltered households in 2022; the estimates are for a single year, so they do not consider multi-year costs; and the estimates do not account for varying assumptions regarding self-resolution or other potential program exits and geographic differences in program costs and affordable housing supply. Concerns about program quality improvements and consistent fidelity to the Housing First approach should also be a focus of future research and analysis.In 2022, homeless response systems only had the capacity to place 16.0% of households who were served in the nations shelters into permanent housing. Housing everyone who experiences sheltered homelessness during a given year would be a substantial step forward in ending homelessness.In this study, we ask: What would it cost to provide a Housing First placement to every household staying in a homeless shelter throughout the United States?We conservatively estimate that an additional $9.6 billion would be needed to achieve this goal: providing Rapid Re-Housing or Permanent Supportive Housing to everyone in a homeless shelter unable to access housing in a single year.Our analysis uses the most recently available Annual Homelessness Assessment Report (AHAR) Part 2, Supportive Services for Veteran Families (SSVF) Annual Report, and U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Homeless Programs Office data to estimate program placement rates, unmet need, and funding required to house every adult, family, and veteran household that stayed in a shelter in 2022.",
