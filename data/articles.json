    "abstract": "An analysis of 8,251 homeless children in New York City found that 18% of them received child welfare services over the five-year period following their first shelter admission, and an additional 6% had a history of having received such services before their first shelter admission. Recurrent use of public shelters, exposure to domestic violence, older age at first episode of homelessness, and larger number of children in a household were associated with an increased risk of child welfare involvement. The high rate of crossover between homelessness and the child welfare system suggests the need for service coordination for children in homeless families.",

    "abstract": "Research suggests that as many as 110,000 single adults with severe mental illness (SMI) are homeless on any given day in the United States. The combination of mental illness and homelessness make this population especially hard to reach through either housing or mental health programs alone. Supportive housing programs, which provide independent housing along with health and social services, hold great promise for this population, but are costly to launch and maintain. This Issue Brief highlights a landmark study that examines the extent to which supportive housing costs are offset by reductions in the use of public services for health, corrections, and shelter.",

    "abstract": "This paper describes methods for conducting equity-focused needs assessments in human service organizations (HSOs). We begin with an overview of needs assessments in social welfare, then describe a three-phase methodology for bringing an equity lens to traditional needs assessment approaches. Central to this methodology is convening stakeholders and addressing issues of power and trust between those leading the needs assessment and those impacted by the process. Key challenges for executing equity-focused needs assessments are discussed, including the need to coordinate across multiple levels of government; enhance collaboration between academics, practitioners, and communities; and improve secure access to high-quality data for analysis.",
